    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect for $60 (2G/16GB).  I had tried 2 BLU phones twice before and both were terrible.  I've had other smartphones from every make but Apple & OnePlus & usually such to the lower to mid-level our yesterday's flagships.  I was hoping these specs would make this BLU better... ..and they do.  By a country mile this phone is better than ANYthing else I've ever used under $100.  Great auto-adjust brightness (goes bright & dark enough for my tastes) screen made of Gorilla Glass, predictive text is accurate, screen navigation is smooth & responsive, GPS location fix nearly immediate, the camera is average, ditto with the speaker.  Call quality & signal strength is very good.  Battery life is above average for sure.  I have yet to have any freezing it delay issues.  I honestly don't even notice the ads most of the time.  I'm using the dual sim feature with a MetroPCS sim in one and a Cricket Sim in the other and it works flawlessly.  I'm thoroughly impressed that an unlocked dual-sim phone that works this well is just $60.  It indeed is worth the $110 for the ad-free version but $60 for barely noticeable ads makes this the best bargain in Smartphones right now in 2016 in the U.S. to me.  WONDERFUL job BLU & Amazon!!!  What Fire Phone lol?  (been there, done that too.  This offering smokes that)",

    "text": "The phone is really nice for the price. The only problem I had that was a hassle was the SD Card when inserted ask to be used as Internal or External Storage, I chose internal and this let the phone work but some apps would not work and others ran very slow. After not being able to use the SD Card for storing music through an app so I looked at it and the phone when using the SD Card as internal storage corrupts the SD Card messing up the partitions. To fix this take the SD Card out put it into a card reader on your PC and use a Disk Partition app and redo the partitions with default options and reformat it with default options. You can then put it back into the phone and this time select to use it as external storage. It may want to reformat the SD card again that is fine.After doing this the apps the did not work now worked, apps that was slow open fast and the SD card is now seen by all programs and able to be used.",

    "text": "This phone is a great deal for the price.  I bought the 16 GB storage, 2 GB RAM version.  My previous phone was a Galaxy Grand Prime, and before that the Amazon Fire phone with Cyanogenmod 11 installed.The build quality is spectacular compared to other budget phones.  The frame is metal, the screen uses Gorilla Glass and also curves in at the edges, and overall it feels very solid.  The screen is bright enough to be clearly readable in sunlight, which is a huge plus.  It also is a pretty high resolution compared to my previous phones.Software wise, Android 6 is a large plus as well.  If the 16 gigs of internal storage isn't enough, Android 6 can use your SD card as internal storage instead of just moving supported apps to SD.  The phone performs quite well too, not a whole lot of lag.The Amazon advertisements on the Prime version of the phone are not intrusive at all, just appearing on the lock screen as a banner if you have other notifications, or full screen with no notifications.  The ads are gone right when you unlock the phone.The only major downfall is the fact that the battery is not replaceable.  The rear cover comes off, but only to insert your SIM and SD cards, or to view Serial and IMEI information.  Still, this is a great value at the 60 dollar mark for Prime account users",

All of those tasks are a breeze on this phone. Setup was easy (I have Cricket wireless); I just pulled the SIM card from my old phone, stuck it in this baby, and was set to go. Signal strength and 4G have been great so far. You can insert an SD card, which allows you to add directly to the internal memory, leaving plenty of storage space for the average user. The screen is beautiful, seems durable, and stays fairly clean. This thing is fast! I have never had any lag or slowness commonly found in \"cheap\" phones. Like others said, definitely spend the extra $10 to upgrade to faster processing and more storage. I have yet to have any problems with this phone. I usually don't even notice the ads on the lock screen, and sometimes you can actually get a good deal if you pay attention. This phone has so many features that most low end phones don't. The one knock in my opinion has been mentioned by others, the speaker quality is not very good. Considering I use the phone almost every day to listen to music, that is disappointing. Overall, I really like this phone and am so glad Amazon has chosen to get back into the cell phone market!!",

I have taken it to Central America and it's an unlocked phone so I can use their Sims card there \"plus I can come back home here in the states and use this cell with one of the companies here,, I like this phone it's nice for the price $59 I could not beat it 2nd review my blu is still going...going to get my wife one with case and screen protector.but for 59.oo bucks plus extras..I can't beat it... Update...Feb23..Hey guys this is Ted just wanted to tell you about the blue h R1 phone . So far it's been a great father like I said as long as you get a case for it and screen for it this phone has Gorilla Glass. I've had it for pretty good bit for time and I love it. Thinking about buying another one with the protective case and everything else.great cellphone..update 5/9/17 had trouble with update made the internet hard to pick up each time it would kick me off of Amazon movies. But so far so good been a good  phone. Should make all their phones basically as strong with good glass Gorilla Glass and a nice design. I would buy another one.update..6/15/17 my BLU phone has been perfect until the update from blew itself now the phone will not let me keep on prime or anything. Has anybody heard of the same problem. It's been a great phone going back and forth to Panama and back because it's unlocked and this is probably one of the best phones that blue makes but with these updates it really has messed up everything. They updated to a new version of 6.0 and it had just it kicks me off of my Wi-Fi each time.... How do I know it is the update has because they did this before and it kicked me off in my Wi-Fi then put a Band-Aid or a patch and it went back to normal I'm once more and I'm back to being kicked off.. can't get in touch with Blu not to tell him how great their cell is or anything... Well I did call Blu and they told me and a nice way that I could try to restart this Blu phone. What happened was I got of course a update in the $59 phone that I got for Amazon went bad. I will not buy another Blu phone that's why I bought a Motorola with the same Amazon app. The man from Blu who lives in Miami can spend his money anyway he wants but he's not getting any more of mine.",

As a longtime fan of ALL things AMAZON, choosing this was a no-brainer for me. This unlocked  phone was simple to set up, looks and feels like a high end model at a fraction of the price! Beautiful HD display, curved Gorilla glass screen, the latest Android operating system, fast, responsive and easy to use!  I laughed when my sister told me she paid $700 for her new Samsung. At $60, the RD1 HD does everything that I need it to do and does it extremely well. I know that there are many \"phone snobs\" out there who are more concerned with status than practically, affordability and functionality: to them I say: \"it's your money, I'm laughing all the way to the bank!\"  No problems whatsoever with this phone, I love it!!

Surprisingly, as a phone, it does everything that most people do (social media, YouTube, texting, calls, web browsing, and etc) really well. Of course it's not blazing fast, but comparable to the speed of an iPhone 5. I wouldn't buy this for the camera, but it outperforms other phones in the sub-100 dollar category. Speaker is not that loud, but acceptable for this price. The display is vibrant, but definitely not as good as amoled. Resolution wise, you shouldn't worry unless you're nit picky; YouTube videos at 720p look fabulous and not only does it use less Internet data, it uses less battery too. And speaking of the battery, the battery life of this phone is just phenomenal! I'm getting 2 days with moderate use with about 7 hours of screen on time, and with heavy use, you'll get over 5 hours, which is fantastic. Call quality sounds good with VoLTE and everything else is good. I highly recommend the 2 gb of ram model because it can handle more apps at once better.

    "text": "I bit the bullet and bought the 16 GB/2 MB of RAM Blu R1 HD phone, and I have absolutely no regrets. For the price, I was expecting merely adequate, but it has worked flawlessly for me from word go and is excellent in terms of no lag with varying applications.I have also tested the headphone jack on my phone, and the sound is absolutely fine! I'm guessing those who are having that issue may merely have a defective phone. In that event, contact Amazon! I have dealt with their customer service representatives for other issues and they couldn't be nicer or more helpful.If I do have any complaints, it is one that has already been mentioned, the sort of tinny sound of the speaker, but neither is it awful. That is probably the only merely \"fair to decent\" part of this phone. Calls work great, all of the Amazon apps are there in a pinch, which means not having to waste more space in downloading them. Video quality is excellent and with the Google Play store, the app selection is terrific!I'm nowhere near a selfie queen, but for the price, the camera seems to be of good quality, if not outstanding. But if you're like me and not photo bomb happy, it shouldn't be a huge deal. If you do like a ton of pictures, the camera is perfectly serviceable and the settings are adjustable, as is the video quality/settings, so that's a plus. It'll never match a picture from a higher-end phone, perhaps, but again, for the price, it's impressive enough. Just remember to remove the little piece of plastic that covers the lens when unboxing!I love that this is a dual-Sim phone, even if I'm only using one Sim card slot right now. But I like that the option exists for more. Setup with AT&T;/Tracfone (for me, there are other listed carrier options when buying this phone) could not have been simpler and I was up and going in no time.The screen is also impressive in terms of size, comparable to the \"flagship\" phones like iPhone. But in my experience, this phone is almost just as good as iPhone for maybe not even a quarter of the price. If you're a Prime member (as I am), don't hesitate and get this phone and save some of your hard-earned money for other stuff! (Heck, even if you're not a Prime member, the phone, I believe, is around $109, still much less than the higher-end phones, so it's still one hell of a deal.)One last thing, this is my first Blu phone, and I have seen some say the phone does not offer updates, but mine did updates right out of the box along with the apps, so we'll see if that continues...Anyway, if your budget doesn't allow for an expensive phone right now, the Blu R1 HD phone is a fantastic alternative for much less! It's a budget phone with a higher-end look/feel.",

My daugthers both have iPod Touches one is a gen 5 and the other is a gen 6.  A few updates back the gen 5 no longer works even after factory resets.  The gen 6 works but without GPS she is always off and never can catch the pokemon the rest of the family with GPS enabled phones find.  I have lent my iPad to my daughter which works great if we drive places but I am not about to let her walk down the street with an iPad which bought me to this BLU phone.  I was looking for a cheap GPS enabled phone with the sole purpose of playing pokemon go.  I don't plan on getting service on her device just tether it to mine when we go out.  I purchased the phone and set it up with only pokemon go and it worked great for the first 3-4 hours and then the problems started.  The game would lock up the person would stop moving and I tried closing the app and\\or resting the phone and that would work for a little bit but it would quick stop working again.  I got fed up and handed he my iPad and off we went without issues for a few more hours when she had issues with the GPS since the iPad doesn't have GPS so I handed her back the BLU phone and it worked for the rest of our journey.  We are an iPhone family and the kids know how to use those.  Andorid was a bit of a change so that will take some getting use to. This testing was done during the water event so it could have just been overloaded servers.Pokemon Go:As for my adventure listed above when you click on a pokemon from from within settings the picture of the pokemon would take longer than on my iPhone which wasn't a deal killer just something I noticed.  I also purchased the upgraded BLU phone in hopes that would be better but Amazon released another new phone at the same price with a snapdragon processor which according to my coworker who is into that type of stuff rated much higher than this mediatek processor found in the blu phones.  I ordered the Alcatel A30 so hopefully this one will work better.",

I has delivered what was expected, you get the best bang for the buck a the price range (Amazon Ads). It is not super fast as expected but with with Android 6.0 the external memory card can be used as main memory, so the 16 GB is not a problem. My unit was updated to use LTE Band 12 OTA and it worked in Peru (Claro) fine. It did not work with Cellcom in Israel since Cellcom uses Band 3 which is not supported, I ended up with 3+G, a bit slow but it worked fine.I'll be taking it to Croatia and see if the LTE works over there. One drawback that I have noticed lately is that it seem WiFi is draining the battery a bit too fast, Even with smart power management, the WiFi seems to drain 30 to 40% of the battery overnight, and it won't last through the day.Update 8/12/17. I just got the June 2017 OTA update. For whatever reason, the OTA download stalls, I tried turning off all power saving modes and leaving the unit plugged close to the Wi-Fi router but the only thing that would work was to pause then resume the download. Weird.Based on my recommendation, my son bought it as a travel phone. He used it Italy and it worked fine in LTE mode.",

I'm a huge fan of Google and their help in this instance only served to strengthen that loyalty.But the replacement would take 7 days and a wife without a cellphone is not a happy wife so I ordered this phone from Amazon and paid a few dollars for next day shipping.  The phone arrived on schedule and we went about setting it up.  I wrongly assumed that it would take a nano SIM.  It does not, it has provision for two micro SIMs.  So, of you are ordering it as I did as a backup, and don't have a micro SIM, be sure to order a SIM adapter kit.After a bit of fiddlibg, I got the nano SIM positioned so it would work and everything was smooth sailing from there forward.I especially like the fact that it runs stock Android.  Amaon has pre-installed a couple of their apps which we would have installed anyway but there is no vendor crap ware to deal with.The phone is responsive, video playback is smooth and the form factor is nice.  It is not a high end Nexus or Samsung phone, but at less that 10% or the price of the flagships, it is a solid performer, especially as a backup device.  When we travel in the future, it will ride along as a backup.  Highly recommended.  The five stars reflect the \"bang for the buck.\". Otherwise I'd give it four stars.

Magic touch I guess). The salesman was impressed with this phone as he had never seen one! He commented on how fast it was and how well made it seemed to be. He was even impressed with the peel off back instead of the kind you slide on that comes off too easily if dropped (the battery is built in too so not battery to fall out).Overall, the function of this phone is great, especially given the price point. The camera is pretty for the price as well. Knock on wood, but even though I got a fairly deep scratch at the bottom corner of my screen early on, it has not worsened, and though my phone has been dropped several times, the screen has not cracked (I do have an around the edge case). Few issues: every now and then, it will start up in a programming mode and there doesn't seem to be a way to chose the listed options so I have to force it down by holding the power button until it goes off. After seven months of usage, I feel the battery isn't holding up as well as it should be. The battery is built in so you can't change it (this is also a perk...). I also wish the charge port was on the top or side as cords get bent if using it while charging.All in all, I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone not looking to spend hundreds while still getting a great phone.",

Let me start by saying that I have given my Note 4 to my father. I started using the R1 as a little experiment, thinking I'd be back to my old phone in a week. Man, was I wrong. This phone feels way faster than the Note 4 due to the stock Android 6.0 experience. When compared to bloated Touchwiz, it seems blazingly fast. Battery life is also incredibly good, I'd say twice as good as the Note 4 was. It's not too big so you can comfortably use it with one hand, but it's not too small to be hard to read or watch videos. The size is perfect because I always thought the Note 4 was a bit too big. And you can actually see the display in broad daylight unlike the Note 4! I've played many games on it and they run perfectly, and it doesn't get nearly as hot as my Note 4 did which always felt like overheating during games. I can't believe I spent $800 on the Note 4 and this $60 phone just blows it out of the water in every respect.Edit: I don't use the camera very much so I forgot to mention it. The camera is the only real downside, taking average quality pictures. If you're coming from a flagship that costs 10x this, don't expect to be blown away. And if the camera is really that important, I would recommend a more expensive phone.Edit: Lockscreen apps do not work anymore in removing ads. It is very easy however, if you can flash TWRP and then look up \"guide R1 HD bloatware XDA\" on Google.",

I took the plunge and ordered this phone, taking advantage of Prime with same day delivery.Because, I always like to transfer my texts, pis and apps to my new phone, My first steps because (while keeping my SIM card in my old phone), were as follows:1) Downloaded the app \"Share It\" on my old phone \"Sender\" phone,  so that I could easily transfer my apps and pics to the Blu. Used the wifi on Blu  download it there as well as the \"Receiver\" phone.2) Backed up my \"Whatsapp\" logs to my Google Drive3) Downloaded the app \"SMS Backup & Restore\" for text messagesOnce all that was done, I know moved the SIM card now Blu phone. And proceed to download the the same apps as above, set up my preferences, install and update all my other apps as needed.  I found this model to be user friendly, visually appealing and works as well as other higher end model phones.I did have an issue with not receiving calls or making calls (which happened after I was initially able to, weird). I called up Blu's customer service number, the operator who walked me thru updating my phone's software. Once I did that using wifi, the phone took about 15 minutes or so to download and install all the necessary 30+ updates. Viola, the issue was resolved. For $65 (after taxes), this probably the least expensive phone, I've ever purchased but is seems to be a great value. I have speed, a great looking phone for less than $100 and now I freedom also use it internationally. The ads are a very minor annoyance, but since I'm on budget I didn't splurge the model without ads.I'm old fashioned so having a headphone jack (not a fan of BlueTooth, yes I'm relic). My next purchases will be the protective case, a screen cover and MicroSD for additional storage. Camera / photo quality doesn't seem like the best, but it is adequate for my needs. Sound quality is also fairly decent.So far so good. If this continues Blu will have a customer for life.Sept 6th - I'm starting to have issues with phone charging. It's taking forever to charge and sometimes the phone seems to just shut its self off. Not sure what's going on, I see that this is been mentioned in a few comments.  My screen also shattered in the up right corner but thats total user error because I stupidly had temporarily taken off the case. But even with a some cracks it was functioning.",

    "text": "I wanted a phone that did a simple job.  Let me text, let me talk and let me take pictures.  The BLU R1 HD for Prime members does just that, and with the subsidized price to $59.99 for a 16GB version is worth the advertisements.  They sit nicely on the lock screen, and really they can be ignored.  Sometimes they show relevant items, other times it's tv shows.  But that's not a problem at all since the rest of the phone is great.Roughly the same size as a Samsung Galaxy S5, this phone only has two buttons.  A power button, and a rocker volume button.  The navigation is all built into the phone screen.  I was pretty intrigued by the way the phone handles.  I got this phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5, and it does a fairly good job.  The weight is less, and it comes with a SD card slot that takes a 64GB card.  One of the many problems I had with the S5 was the SDcard would corrupt, or not load if over 4GB of video was stored to it.  That doesn't happen with the BLU R1 HD.  The software for the BLU is lacking compared to the S5.  The S5 comes with a plethora of settings, adjustments and so forth.  The BLU is bare bones minimum.  But a lot of the features in the S5 were not ever used by me.  So losing them didn't matter.  Using the S5 required a lot of charging time.  I would find even if the phone sat idle on my table from a full charge, it would drain to 28-38% left by 4pm.  So it was common for me to charge the S5 on and off each day.  But the BLU, being stripped down of many background processes and routines, has a far superior battery life.  I can leave the phone 12 hours on idle, and still have a 75% charge left.  This truly awesome to me.Other features the BLU does that outshines other phones, is a sleep mode.  You can set schedules on the BLU to turn itself off at a perticular time, and then it will turn itself back on at another.  I like to set mine to turn off at 11pm, and then to wake at 6am.  Then at 7am my alarm goes off on the phone to wake me.  By having the phone shut off for 7 hours a night, it practically extends the battery life.  I have used a 100% charge for 2 days without additional charging, having used maybe 2 hours of talk time, and 20 minutes of watching youtube on it.  It finally reached a 3% charge at close to 47 hours from start to stop.  So, I've been impressed with what this phone can do.For me, this is a great phone at a bargain price.  It isn't water proof, or shatter proof, or got a lot of bells and whistles like NFC or accelerators.But what it will do is help you lower your bill.  You can take this phone and get a t-mobile family plan at walmart.  If you mostly just use 1GB or less of data a month, you can get a $30 plan.  It's  unlimited calling, texting, and 1GB LTE4G data.  This is why this phone is great.  I took my $90/month sprint bill with a $600 phone, and lowered it to $30 and a $60 phone.  Significant savings.  Just make sure you use your work wifi and home wifi all the time and you will never have to worry about data.The reason I gave this phone only a 4 out of 5 stars is because it still needs some work.  The phone has a problem with understanding my Beyond app which plays podcasts.  If my bluetooth headset is sync'd, and I start to play a podcast through the app, it works fine - but if I get a text alert or open another app that might start playing music - the entire phone starts to freeze up.  I have to reboot the phone completely to fix it.The other issue I have with the phone is that the battery cannot be removed.  It can be if you have the right tools and expertise to do it, but if the phone freezes and you cannot turn it off to reboot, it would be great to take the battery out to full reset.  Since you can't, I can see it being an issue later.  BUT, it is a $60 phone if you get the advertisements.  Sooooo, that's still a good deal.The final problem I notice is that on the Lock Screen, it will marquee scroll in the notifications area that I do not have service for my Family Plan from t-mobile - which is clearly a glitch because I do have coverage, full bars with LTE4G.  It does that all the time.",

I'm happy the phone didn't have all these crazy apps that you can't remove, and don't use,  and takes up all your valuable ram.I had a galaxy S5 that I had to replace, but I knew the price was out of my budget,  so I found this offer just in time,  and I can tell you I'm really happy with the specs and the quality of this phone,  I wasn't sure about the Brand,  but I have it an chance and I am happy,  The sound quality is great,  the screen resolution is excellent,  and excellent response time. and this phone gives you 2GB of Ram,  at Metro PCS a phone with 2GB of ram  can go for 200 + (04/26/2017).",

This is actually a really nice phone for the money.  Sure, the camera is crap and the speaker is on the back so when you have it laying face-up on the table it blocks the sound but aside from that, this thing is quick, feels solid and of a good weight in your hand and will be an awesome back-up phone for traveling or for when one of your kids drops theirs and shatters the screen.  The ads on the lock-screen are of little notice and not intrusive in my opinion.  It's a single box under the notifications and usually Amazon is advertising something new on Prime Video, which I'm OK with anyway.  It's not a problem.  I even have been showing others what a nice phone it is for the $60 Prime-member price I got it for.  I bought a 32GB SD card for $11 to slap in it and viola! up to 48GB and I've got a whopping $71 into this thing. Recommended.",

    "text": "This phone is a great alternative to the absurdly priced tier 1 phones from samsung and apple.  I have been using this phone for about a month now and, for the most part, have no legitimate qualms with the phone.  Yes, it is a LITTLE  bit slower than my old iPhone 6S (broken now) but it still does everything.  I can play games, link up my email accounts, take pictures (thought photo quality significantly reduced and there is no slow-mo mode).  Leaving iOS was the hardest part but I'm happy that I got out of that eco-system.The glass on this phone screen is a little softer than my iPhone screen.  I didn't break it, but it is more susceptible to scratches. I am one of those people that doesn't use a screen cover and my Blu phone got a small scratch on the corner of the screen.What about the ads?  I don't even notice the lock screen ad any more.  You can move the home screen (app screen) advertisement to the last page of applications so you never see it.What do I love?  Price, app availability, tethering is unlocked, there are no iphone functions that I miss.What do I miss?  thumb print unlock, processor speed, camera quality",

    "text": "Just received the Blu R1 HD. I got it as a backup phone since my LG G4 was having some repairs done. The version I purchased is the Amazon ad-subsidized edition with the 2GB RAM.First impressions are very good. It feels sturdy and not at all cheap, even for a $100.00 phone if you'd paid full price. Its very clearly 'inspired' by the look of recent iPhones, but it's not a bad thing at all.It's light but has a good 'heft', closer to the feel of a premium phone than of your gas store 'burner type' phones. The rounded edges (which feel like metal) give the phone a comfortable grip, and the power and volume buttons (on the right side of the phone) are very easy to use while holding the phone with one hand.The back cover, which can be removed to access the dual sim slots and the SD card slot, is a matte black plastic cover. Its the weakest part of the 'look and feel' of the phone but it's not a huge issue, as it's not something you'd often look at and it does the job just fine.So far, it's been very responsive for regular tasks like text, calls, email, YouTube and Pokemon Go. Other than the Amazon loaded apps, it's a very stock Android experience which is a good thing in my opinion. It may throw off someone used to Samsung or LGs overlays.So far, I'm very happy with the purchase. I'll update the review as I play around with it more.",

The headphone volume level is inadequate and just not very good but again this is also a problem I find with blu phones so no unexpected.  But the biggest problem is the external speaker is terrible.  I cannot hear hardly anything out of it. You are better off to keep it on vibrate. You are more likely to hear the vibration than the speaker notification.  Having said all that. . . Given the choice of owning this outright or having a contract on a flagship phone I will take this any day of the week.  I can deal with these small issues. They can be overcome.  For $59 thanks to Prime this is a steal.  Buy it and get an mp3 player or a headphone amplifier.  It's still way cheaper.  Well worth the money. Great battery life and performance and the stripped down version of Android is refreshing.  All my apps work great and the cameras are adequate.

I was very hesitant since I have been an iPhone person since the beginning, we are talking YEARS!! (As well as a MacBook user.) For $59.99 vs. well over $600 for a new iPhone, I am sold 100%. I have had the phone for a few days now and I LOVE IT!!! Here's how things went...The BLU phone is larger than my iPhone 5s so that is nice. Screen is bright and colors good. Really like the curved screen.I stopped by ATT and they hooked me up with the sim card, no charge.I was able to save all of my contacts to a file, down loaded it to BLU; perfect, no issues, all contacts intact.All of my photos are on Amazon photo, so no issues there, I can see all of my photos.I found all of the apps that I had on my iPhone in Google Play Store, have them all set up and working, no problems.I got the ad version of the BLU, but not really an issue for me since I love Amazon. If you are not a big Amazon person, you might want to pay a little more for the ad-free version, but I really don't see it as an issue.I already had a Google account, so email was a matter of signing into Google. No problem.I set up another email account (not Google), just followed the instructions, used the info from my other phone and put in the right settings, up and running in about 5 min.My iPhone had the fingerprint scanner, but for $59.99 vs. $600+ I don't need it. Someone told me I can download a fingerprint app, but I have not looked into that yet. Really only had two apps that I used it on and it seldom worked on my lock screen anyway.There was not a voicemail app preloaded like the iPhone, but I found ATT Visual Voicemail and it works just like the iPhone app. In fact it will transcribe the voicemail to text if it can understand the person calling.The camera is the same as my iPhone 5s. I have not taken any photos yet. But if I want high quality photos, I use a real digital camera, not a phone.With all of this done, I am at 66% on my memory. My iPhone was FULL. A lot of that was my photos that I no longer have on my phone, but have access to in Amazon photo. I have not added an SD card yet, but will likely do so since I usually run out of memory when on vacation taking lots of photos.I have not found anything that this phone cannot do when compared to the iPhone 5s I replaced.Luv BLU!!

This is easily twice the phone for literally half what I paid for the 5+5!The 2 gig memory (not storage) is what sold this model for me. NO phone offers 2 gig of RAM anywhere near this price. I do not run a lot on my phone but what I do needs RAM and many phones only have 1 gig and by the time all the junk of the OS loads you have maybe a little over half usable for your apps. I took my SIM out of my 5+5 and dropped it in this one (I use Strait Talk and have been told that does not work but it did for me). Perhaps is because I am going from a BLU phone to another BLU phone but it works. I have noticed the R1 does not get as good of a signal according to the indicator yet I have not noticed any drops in calls or anything but I have noticed issues with data because of the lower signal but I am on wifi all the time except when it goes out so long as the texting and calls get through I am fine with it.This does not come with the extras you normally get with BLU phones but not missed at all (earbuds, screen protector and gel case).The lock screen ads do not bother me in the slightest and I HATE ads on my phone. You swipe to unlock and ad is gone till the phone goes dark. The ad is VERY unobtrusive to me.Snappy and quick this phone is. Sound quality is good and the gorilla glass hides most prints and smudges well. Camera is adequate and very good for this price range with focus and a nice feature set of ways to edit and enhance your photos. Images on the screen look really good to me, especially for a 60 dollar phone.Other than signal strength if I had a strong critique it would be non-removable battery but moreso the way SIM cards are installed. It is a slide back then lift then close and slide forward. I was not getting that from the instructions and thought I had broke it as it would not latch closed. Was by accident I discovered it was a sliding lock down.As I have said after I spend more time will update my review but glad I bought one so far.UPDATE: If you have not already go under settings then about phone and tap on wireless update. There is, what I am assuming, the promised update available. Took me about 10 minutes for it to complete.",

    "text": "I bought this phone as a replacement for my HTC One(m7) phone, which had recently died after roughly 4 years of regular usage. I really did not want to upgrade to a new phone, my wife just got a Galaxy S8, but I haven't really seen a new phone that stood out to me like the M7 did when it was first released. I decided to go a different route and just got a 'good enough' budget replacement rather than a brand new, flashy one. I will say I was pleasantly surprised. For it's price point, it's a really reliable phone. I don't mind dealing with one extra swipe(for the ad screen) to access my phone since this is literally a fraction of the price of other phones.This phone is not without its flaws though. I have had some connectivity issues with things other than the mobile network. For instance, the wifi isn't the best. I use a wi-fi extender to strengthen my connection throughout my house and this phone struggles in automatically connecting to the appropriate one. My HTC One(m7) which I got back in 2013 did not have any issues with this, nor did my wife's Galaxy S6 or S8, neither does any other tablet or wifi device in our household. I usually have to manually deactivate then reactivate my phone's wifi, otherwise it will remain disconnected.Also, I sometimes have issues with bluetooth disconnecting, which other phones do not struggle with.As far as power, it definitely leaves a lot to be desired. As stated earlier, my previous phone was an HTC One(m7), which debuted in 2013. That HTC was hands-down better in all aspects(call quality, connectivity, design, screen, camera, audio, operating speed) even though it is multiple years older.I'm also a bit disappointed that this phone isn't dual band. It cannot connect to 5GHz band.All in all, this is still a great budget phone and I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a budget phone. It definitely isn't comparable to today's top phones, but you shouldn't expect it to be at this price point. It's call quality is more than acceptable, it's fast enough to run most apps and games I've tried. It has an acceptable camera and isn't overtly sluggish. For what I was expecting, I can't say I'm disappointed in this purchase.",

I have the 2 gig of ram and 16 gigs of memory version.Here are some of my opinions on the phone.It has a decent to average camera. I don't really take selfies or pictures so this is not a big deal. When I do take pics I like how they come out with this phone.The speaker does not get loud. At maximum value you do not get any rattle or static noise so that's a good thing. I usually have it connected to my ear phone or the Bluetooth in my car. You can hear the sound in a quiet surrounding.The battery life on the phone is pretty good. It lasts me a full day with minimal use. Screen on time usually last me between 4.5 hours or maybe 5. When use YouTube alot and play Pokemon Go throughout the day, I do have to recharge in the middle of the day.PokemonGo is the only game I play on my phone so I don't know how the performance is when it comes to gaming.Like I mentioned I watch YouTube videos, Hulu Netflix alot on my phone and I have to say the picture quality is good.Lastly performance is good, it is not the fastest phone but it gets the job done.I really hope this phone gets the update to enable band 12 since I have this phone with T mobile.Once that happens this will be the best bang for your buck phone I've bought.",

I mention this because I tested the camera as soon as I received the phone and found the same issues, I compared it to a Nexus 5 (old and repaired several times) and the BLU was not as good. There was  not comparison when compared to my Nexus 6. But once the protective cover was removed from the back camera it was equivalent to the Nexus 5.The second flaw is when you use the phone in speaker phone mode, the unit struggles with digitization of voices versus background noise, for example in a car. Which make the call for the receiver every difficult. Obviously the user of the phone does not notice this.For the $59 paid for the phone its a no brainer to buy it and that is why it gets for 4 stars and not five as its flaws do not outweigh it's value",

FreedomPop requires the installation of the FreedomPop Messaging app and after I do that, I can no longer initiate Tracfone calls, and I have not yet been able to get FreedomPop calls to work. It seems that the FreedomPop Messaging app affects the Android dialer preventing it from initiating Tracfone or Google Voice calls.

I bought this to quickly replace my ASUS Zenfone 2 after the communication chip went bad, and I honestly don't miss the ASUS much considering it was over twice as powerful both in processor specs and RAM. This phone is not only pretty good performance wise, but it's also  a very attractive and solid-built phone. I was surprised to see that I could play GTA 3 on it.SOMETIMES it will slow down pretty badly, but all you'll need to do is make sure to clear the RAM every once in a while, and you should be good. I'm a software engineer, so I usually don't want something if it doesn't have a 128 core processor and way more RAM than I need, but this is a great device. Also, because it's not super powerful, the battery life is excellent. I'd say it probably lasts about 150% longer than my ASUS did even though the battery is 500 milli amp hours smaller.Don't listen to those that complain about the ads. The are about as non-intrusive as possible. They're only on the lock screen.If you need a good phone but don't have much cash, look no further.",

For whatever reason, it turned on the screen to display a message (that I never saw, it was sitting face down on my bed), and proceeded to become incredibly hot to the touch.  Unfortunately, there is not a replaceable battery and I'm fairly certain that this phone's battery is now toast.  :/  Once it's been powered off for a while I will see if it charges or keeps any sort of charge or not...  Owned the phone for a few months now.**Updated review! Pt1I'm on AT&T; and I was unable to get LTE (Was just showing up as 4G).  I had gone in to get a new SIM card and register my IMEI in a store, and that caused problems.  If you put in an LTE-activated sim card (if you were already on AT&T;) things should work right out of the box for LTE.  When I registered this phone, it showed up as \"Unknown Device\" in my account, and when that happens, even if it's an LTE-enabled phone, AT&T; will only allow you to get HSPA/HSPA+.  I contacted support via chat and gave a \"dummy\" IMEI of my old bricked Nexus 5, and I instantly got LTE at that point.  I also notified them and they said they should be able to override this issue if they explain what's going on.  Hope this helps people!****I like this phone.  Decent battery life, sleek design, the ads aren't too bad, either.  It's a great cheapy Pokemon Go phone, but there's no gyro so you can't do AR (for those who care, or for youngins who may want that).

    "text": "Alright so you've read every review there is about the $50 wonder phone from BLU. I'm here to give you the scoop in a language that's understandable because let's me honest if you're looking at the R1 HD tech specs don't top the list of necessity on your mobile device. Read on and email BLU to let them know theh should give me a cut of every R1 HD sold on Amazon.Also I waited almost four months to write this review so I could get a real feel on how this phone handles. I have a secondary line that I use for work (tax write of purposes) I mean to play with unlocked phones.The list....Display 3/5 So can you see everything clearly that you would use a phone for??? Yup.. But don't think your gonna watch the newest flick off your KODI app with great detail. For one the color saturation is horrible and even with the 2gb ram version of this phone running KODI will ensure a restart of your phone. Don't get me wrong the display is not horrible but it's not great either. If your using it for basic phone applications or even games your fine. If you plan on downloading movies and watching them your outta luck.Battery 3/5 Like I said I use this as a secondary phone but I do use it a lot. I constantly  have to take pictures (I'll get into that later), fill out forms and make calls from this phone and the battery life is average at best. When I first bought the phone I would constantly try to see how long it would take with basic use to run dead,  now I make sure it's always on a charger and I have a power brick with me. I would say I get about 6 gourd of average use and I get about a day of stand by with minimal use.Processor 4/5 This phone is not known to be a power house but...... Even with a ton of apps running it runs as smooth as you could ask for without even a hiccup. I think BLU did a great job of b of matching a processor with this phone. It knows what it's capable of and does a great job of doing it. I'm not a gamer but I did download some games known for heavy use of the processor with the goal of trying to freeze this thing and every game ran perfectly. Surfing the web and even websites with heavy information ran fine. Switching through applications was a breeze and for what's supposed to be the low point of this phone I found it to be a high light.Camera 2/5 I use the camera to take about a hundred pictures a day and this is for sure the weakest link of this phone. Natural light, artificial light or no light the pictures come out mediocre at best.Bottom line... I love it. I have the option to use several different phones that I have purchased to play with and I have stuck with the R1 HD. The Amazon ads are not intrusive despite what others say. The size and feel of the phone are perfect for me. I actually like the look, feel and size of this phone better than my Galaxy S7. I don't think I could use this as my daily driver because I use my devices so heavily. As they say you get what you pay for and for $50 or even $100 I'll even say in the $150 price range I'll take this phone over most of the others. If your not a heavy user and just need something to check out Facebook or browse a few websites the R1 HD is a great option. If it's for a back up phone just buy it already your not getting any better in this price range. If you want the latest and greatest obviously its not for you. But at this price point I would suggest buying one as a back up",

I caught myself in the middle of the city needing to call up a Lyft for a ride. If my phone ran out of battery suddenly without me noticing, I would've had no way of getting home because the phone's battery almost ran out. Don't expect the battery life to last that long.

I didn't play it long, but the user experience was comparable to my iphone 6s. This comment may not be fair to iPhone since I didn't install a lot of apps nor did I put tons of load on the phone as I did to my iPhone. But for a phone with such a low price tag, it works great.After days of using it, my mom really likes it. No sluggishness. No sudden crash or freeze. The battery works great.I just ordered another one for my dad, right before my Prime membership expires.Hope both phones can last long, as long as my old iPhones.

Unlike, other budget phones, this will apps save to SD with no problems. The ads are not a big deal. It can make for a pretty lock screen. You can install a different launcher, even a different lock screen. I have not encountered an app that won't work or that the phone will not let you install. I had one app that was running on SD that wouldn't open but it did once I moved it to the phone.I am using it on T-Mobile with no problems, waiting for news on Band 12.Performance wise, it's very smooth. I have experienced no lag on its third day of use. I will update the batter performance as I use it more. I have been on it constantly so it wouldn't be fair to see what it's like on normal use.",

    "text": "I'll start by breaking this review down to what this phone is and what it isn't as opposed to pros and cons as those tend to vary person to person based on intended to use.First, what this phone is.Lets get this out of the way, this a phone that advertises to you. It will do it 24-7 that is part of the deal to get a 60 dollar phone. A good 60 dollar phone at that. At first I thought i couldn't handle the adverts, but, that has passed. I installed my favorite weather app that has a always on notification on the lock screen and I have yet to see a full size lock screen add since.. The adverts are small and pretty unobtrusive once you have a notification on the lock screen. Mostly the ads are for books, games, and movies. No adds are inappropriate and they keep showing the same ones repeatedly and after awhile they are very easy to ignore. Overall for me, it was good trade.Its a budget phone. One that has the look and feel of a much more expensive phone. The fit and finish is really very good for a phone of almost any level. The aluminum side accents with the beveled glass really create a nice aesthetic to it usually reserved for higher end phones.Its great for watching streaming video, listening to streaming music, or listening to music downloaded to the phone. The sound quality that comes out of the phone over bluetooth is good, however, the sound quality that comes over a wired head set is a little flat and a  tinny even with the audio enhancements enabled.The screen is quite impressive for this price point. Its sharp and the colors are nicely saturated without being overly so. One critique I can offer is that it doesn't dim enough (for my tastes) in low light situations. The touch accuracy on the screen is a little unforgiving at first and requires some getting used to in order to be able to get the icon or menu you clicked on to open properly. This seems to be especially noticeable near the edge of the screen. Overall though, the screen is quite impressive and I would put on one level below many of the flagship phones I have had the pleasure of using.Open up a web browser and the phone's performance is more than acceptable. Pages load quickly, movies play with relative ease, pics are fast to load and easy to view and the overall experience is pleasant. However, again the touch screen issues do come into play here and can lead to some mis-taps which may be a little frustrating at times.Phone calls are clear, the voices easily heard over both bluetooth and the phones speaker. I was heard easily and clearly on the other end of the line and the experience was exactly what I expected from a phone.What this phone isn'tIt is not a camera phone. It does have a camera and it captures snapshots of important moments that will look nice on a small screen and to share with friends through text and even on face book in a reduced size. Zoom in, or view them on a large screen, the lack of a high end camera becomes apparent. The photos are soft, and have low saturation with a high level of noise. For most everyday purposes, the camera will get the job done. For those who want this to be the replacement for a good point and shoot or a DSLR or MILS camera, you will be disappointed. For everyone else, this camera will most likely be just fine.This is a phone for gaming on or performing processor heavy tasks on. The processor bogs down loading content intensive pages at times (not to the point that its unbearable but it is noticeable) so trying to play a graphics laden game of performing other tasks that require alot of processing power would probably not go well with this phone.This is not a flagship phone. There is no finger print scanner to unlock it, no extra sensors for fitness tracking, and really not any other frills. Its basic and it gets the job done.Overall, this is a good phone. It works. It makes calls, it plays music and videos, and does that well all while looking and feeling much better than a 60 dollar phone has any right too.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this phone! Works fluidly, works as it should. The processor of this phone is fantastic! Functions like a $200 phone, but only for less. I purchased the 8GB + 1 Ram version. Even though it's not as great as the 16GB (Extra space for $60 more w/Amazon promotions & ads. I couldn't afford $10 more dollars more for the 16GB version. Still the 8GB Blu R1 HD works just as fine as the 16GB version. Only difference is storage space.If you're looking for a low budget phone, instead of spending over $200 dollar on an advanced android smartphone, then this the phone for you. Functions just like a smartphone that cost $200 bucks. Overall I'm in love with this phone. I've owned many Blu phones, but this is the 1st time I purchased a Blu phone that has me in awestruck wonder....Like Literally! The curved screen display not to mention the 5.0 inch of the phone itself caught my attention as well, so did the Gorilla Glass that's cornering the edges of the phone, not mention that this phone is absolutely scratch free and doesn't pick up fingerprints at ALL! The visual display of this phone is OUTSTANDING the PIXELS on this phone is AMAZING! GRAND DISPLAY! You can watch some of the best movie's in HD at all TIMES! On a smartphone that cost you as low as $50-$60 dollars. NOT BAD!Good ConsOutstanding Battery Life (This by far out of the Blu Phone's I've had, has the most consistent battery life) You can go a full day with it after 1 full charge.Pixel Clear displayWatch your favorite shows/Movie's in High Definition as the phone says \"HD\"Charges very fast. My sister even in commented on how quick it charges her Samsung Galaxy S4.Phone responds perfectly to swipe of your fingers!Also the ads on the lock-screen (Blu R1HD w/ Promotions & ads version) -Either the 8GM + 1 Ram Version/16GB +2 Ram Version. Doesn't matter. The ads aren't bothersome at all actually. They only appear on the lock-screen. You can can easily swipe it away, even when you have notification the ad turns to notification size so you can easily swipe it away. You can also get rid of ads by following these 13 simple steps. Look Below for the 13 steps.Bad ConsSmall storage space after all it's only 8GB (You can easily fix this problem by purchasing a MicroSD card with bigger GB on it, or you can save up $10 more dollars for the 16GB +2 Ram version which cost $60).Bad picture qualitySound is horrible, when you try and talk on it without use of headphones. (This phone works best with headphones). Especially when it comes to phone calls. Might be a sign of unprofessional when it comes to a possible job offer, if you try talking on this phone without headphones.Camera is all shaky. You have to be absolutely still when taking a picture or else the picture won't come out right. Might have something to do with the Camera Settings though.Disabling Lock Screen Ads1. Open \"Settings\"2.Select \"about device\" at the very bottom.3. Scroll down to \"build number\"4. \"Tap build number\" several times until it says \"You're now a Developer!\"5. Press back and select \"Developer Options\"6.Turn on \"USB debugging\"7.Select \"OK\" on the popup message8. Before continuing, you must have a notification present on your phone so that your lock screen does not show any full ads. If you don't have a notification, press and hold \"volume down\" and \"power button\" until a screenshot is taken. This will add a screenshot notification.9. Plug your phone into a PC using a USB cable. A message will appear on your phone.  Check the box and select \"OK\"10. Open Terminal (MAC) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and run the command: adb start -server11. Verify that your phone is detected by running the command: adb devices12. Hide lock screen ads by running the command: adb shell pm hide  com.amazon.phoenix13. Unplug you phone and you're done.  There will no longer be ads on your lock screen, even when there are no notifications.Feel free to follows these steps to remove the ads off your lock screen for good.",

Considering the slightly inferior plastic feeling to the phone, I would recommend that you get a case and a GLASS screen protector.  This phone is every bit worth the money.  The phone didn't come with the FM radio activated, but there are ways to get it activated if you really want radio on your phone.

    "text": "I'm giving this four-stars right now, but I may bump it up to five later. I just got the phone today and have spent the morning setting it up. The phone I'm replacing was a BLU Studio 5.0 HD LTE which I was using with a pay-as-you-go Straight Talk account. Transferring the service over was as simple as pulling the SIM chip from my old phone and sticking it in the new. I also went ahead and put in a new 64GB memory card (Samsung 64GB EVO Select). The phone had issues with the memory card, telling me it was corrupt and needed reformatting. I let the phone reformat the memory card - but when it was done, it told me that it had a slow transfer rate and I should consider using something else. I going to use the card till I can get another one. I also bought a case for this phone when I ordered it -\u00a0BLU R1 HD ArmorFlex Case + Screen Protector - Black/Black\u00a0- which came with a screen protector. The case looks good on this phone.Like I mentioned, I was already using a BLU phone - there are some differences I noticed. This new phone is pretty bare bones - all you get in the box is the phone and the charger/cord. My other phone had come with a case and screen protectors. Another difference with the two phones - my old one had a removable battery, this new one's battery appears to be part of the phone. That concerns me a bit, as when my old phone would lock up for whatever reason (say during a reboot), it was easy to just pull the battery and then put it back in to get the phone working again.Once I got the sim card and memory card in and the phone turned on - I spent awhile updating a lot of the pre-installed apps and downloading some of my own from my Google Play account. I also had to open a lot of the pre-installed apps and logging into various accounts (like Google, Amazon, Kindle, Audible, Amazon Music, etc.). Speaking of apps - you have access to both Google Play and the Amazon Appstore (now called Amazon Underground), getting to your Amazon apps is a bit more challenging than the Play store - you have to drill down a bit in the Amazon store's menu to get to it.The phone works great - calls seem to be clear, speaker phone mode seems to work OK. I haven't done much with the camera yet - but the one picture I took as a test appears to be good enough for me - but I noticed that there are two settings for photos - 8MP (4:3) & 6MP (16:9), apparently shooting widescreen photos requires you to use 6MP.The lockscreen offers & ads are about as obtrusive as the ones on my Fire / Kindle devices - I'm use to seeing them to the point that I really don't notice them as being that obtrusive.All-in-all I like this new phone and I'm hoping it will serve me as long (or longer) than my last one did (two years). I'm more than happy with my purchase (and the discount that getting the offers & ads model provided me).ETA - just some random observations..1 - This phone seems to be missing some of the basic apps that I had on my previous phone, the default android music player and the sound recorder for instance. I was able to get those from the Google Play store but wondering why those were left off. My old phone also had the capability of doing FM radio (hardware & software), this new phone apparently doesn't have that feature.2 - I don't know if this is something unique to this phone or to Android 6.0 OS, but the phone has two options for using/formatting the 64GB memory card I added to the phone. One option allows you to use the additional memory for apps and data, the other lets you have access to the card to put media on it (music/video/etc). I tried the first way, but wasn't happy that I couldn't access the card directly (via the USB port) to simply drag-and-drop files from my computer onto the card. So I ended up formatting it the other way. But now I'm guessing I can't install apps onto the card. My previous phone allowed me to do both - put media on the card and off-load apps & data to it too.",

Of course the BLU R1 doesn't have a camera as good as the S6 edge plus but it works fine. It's also not as pretty as the S6 but once you put a case on both phones how does that matter.\\This phone has no problem watching videos on Amazon prime and plays Youtube with no problems at all. The screen is sharp and clear. For me less to worry about if something ever happens to it and the fact that it works great is more than enough reason to stop buying over priced cell phones.",

    "text": "IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!!This phone does NOT have NFC capabilities. Which means things like android pay to pay at stores DOES NOT WORK.END UPDATEFirst off, I ordered this phone because my Note 4 finally died on me. I had never heard of a Blu phone until someone told me (from a T-Mobile store actually) that I should get one because it is cheap. I don't care for the Galaxy S8 and I wanted to wait for the Note 8. So I took a chance and bought this phone primarily because of so many positive reviews.Advantages:Cheap phone but quality build (metal), up to date software, good enough camera, and good enough soundDisadvantages:Screen brightness is weak, color quality is not very good, not the fastest phone, a few random restarts, not as many settings as a premium phone.So far I really like the phone and would like to give it 4.5/5 stars rather than 4. It does everything I need a temporary phone to do and thats about it. Don't expect to be wowed when you receive this phone if you are like me. However, you will be surprised of how good it is compared to the price.Unfortunately the major downsides are the brightness and color quality. It isn't a deal breaker in any way but the screen is dim and impossible to see in sunlight. In a shadow or dark room you are fine but it is noticeable when coming from a premium phone. The color is WAY OFF and clearly wrong. Blacks are not truly black and colors are not crisp and sharp but dull and ugly. Also, the sound quality isn't the greatest. It sounds muffled in everything except for phone calls.I have had the phone for about 2.5 weeks now and I have already noticed it slowing down when I am doing anything from swiping to texting to loading an app. It doesn't happen all the time but it has happened. There have been a few times where I have waited 15 to 30 seconds for the phone to catch up. I only hope it doesn't get any worse, I only need the phone to last me maybe 6 months.Overall the phone is a great phone for anyone that is not heavily into premium phones. But once you have used one you definitely would not want to stay with this forever. I don't like buying cheap electronics but this phone with some upgrades could easily be made into a premium phone.",

If you are going somewhere special, make sure to have a good digital camera and/or video camera with you, because this takes terrible pictures.2. The call volume doesn't go high enough. I don't have bad hearing, and I have to turn it all the way up to really hear a conversation.But, hey, for $60, I can't complain. The speed and functionality of the phone is comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S6 I had before. I can do all the same things I did before, such as use Google Maps, play games, use FB Messenger, etc. I highly recommend this for anyone on a tight budget.

As I opened the package, I found a nice looking box in the package.  It was nicely sealed and well packaged.  I opened the tab and could not wait to get my hands on this amazing product.  As I opened the package, the phone was nicely wrapped in a bag with a screen protector on top to protect the screen from scratching.  After I took the protective cover from the phone, I found an amazing looking screen the fitted in my hand nicely.  The curved screen is often found in high-end phone but I was surprised to find in a phone under $60.  Once I got my hands on the phone, I was looking for the battery to put it in and get it started.  However, I could not find the battery.  It turns out that the battery is built in and it is non-replaceable battery.  But that\u2019s ok, for $ 60, still not a bad bargain.  I turned the phone on and it took about 10 minutes for set-up and update the phone.  After that, I put my sim in and I made couple of phone calls.  It has duel sim card slot and one micro SD card slot ( The maximum accepted is 64GB).  The sound quality was very good.  I tried the speaker phone and it was loud as well.  After that I downloaded couple of games to try.  I was blown away with the speed of processer.  It held up very well.  What was more impressive is that it stands by its name HD.  That\u2019s how the picture quality was.  After that, I jumped on Amazon videos and started watching movies.  Again, the clarity of the picture was outstanding.  Another benefit of this phone is that because it is BLU-Amazon partnered phone, you can download Amazon Prime Videos on the phone when you have Wi-Fi so you can watch it offline when you have no internet connection.  To me, it\u2019s a plus benefit.  Now comes the part of actually putting the phone to the LTE test.  It did stand up to the LTE test.  It downloads and uploads in a zoom.  The down side to the phone is that the phone camera quality lacks a little.  However, for $ 60 it is to be expected.  Another reason this phone receives four stars from me is that the manual is very poorly written.  In the packaging there is no headphones like other manufacturers do.  But again, for $ 60 it\u2019s a great phone.  Not advanced as other but very well designed and easy to use phone.THE PROS OF THE PHONEPRICE ( WHEN COMPARED TO OTHERS)1.3 GHz Quad Core ProcesserQUALITY 5.0 \u201c CURVED  SCREEN & RESOLUTION4G LTE UNDER $ 60 (FOR PRIME MEMBERS)ANDROID 6.0 (LATEST VERSION UPON RELEASE OF THIS PHONE)2 GB RAMEXPANDABLE MEMORY (UP TO 64 GB)CONS OF THIS PHONEPOOR PACKAGING ( not bad but could have been better comming from Amazon)POOR MANUALNO HEADPHONESREAR CAMERA (ONLY 8 MP)FRONT CAMERA (5MP)In short\u2026 this is the best phone you can buy under $ 60 (for Prime Members)I AM A NEW REVIEWER THAT HAS ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE PHONE AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT FOR FREE.

    "text": "The reasonably low price is the only thing that is cheap about this smartphone! I purchased this phone with the intent of using it for when I go on vacation (especially abroad) and don\u2019t want to risk anything happening to my expensive iPhone. The fact that it is unlocked makes it easy to just pop in my sim card and go as I see fit.FIRST IMPRESSION:My first impressions of the phone are that although light, it does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d like you would expect a phone in this price range to be. It is about the same size as an iPhone 6, or Samsung Galaxy S5 in case anybody was wondering.Typing on the phone is easy and feels good, due to the responsive feedback. The auto-correct is accurate and makes sending texts messages a breeze.SPEED:The phone features a 1.3 GHz Quad core processor, and 1 GB of ram. Although there ARE phones with better specs out there, I have found that this phone was able to keep up with just about everything I wanted to do, whether it is browse Reddit, order on Amazon, etc. The phone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow which is very easy to navigate and user friendly.CAMERA:The camera quality on the smart phone is OK. Not horrible by any means, but not the best either. The camera does not perform very well in low light, and will take grainy pictures if a good amount of light is not present. Comparing to my iPhone 6s Plus, I have found that although the R1HD does not capture as wide of an area as the iPhone, pictures come out a bit warmer, which was a pleasant surprise. The camera is 8 mega pixels, and the front facing camera is 5 mega pixels. Not bad for $50. I was not impressed with the video option. Videos come out a bit shaky and grainy. Please see my picture and videos for reference.SOUND & CALL QUALITY:The sound quality of the R1HD is good. Calls come in clear and do not sound muffled. I really like that the manufacturers of this phone decided to put the speaker on the back. This means that when lying down and watching videos, the speaker is not covered like on the iPhone. While I do like the placement of the speaker, it is a bit small. I would have liked a dual speaker design like the iPhone. If you plan on showing a group of friends a video, it may be a bit difficult to hear. In short, the speakers are not the strongest. I would definitely recommend using head phones if you plan on listening to videos of movies. The speaker is OK at best.OTHER:The lock screen offers do not get in the way as much as one might think. In fact, I have found that I\u2019ve already been introduced to some products I wouldn\u2019t have normally known about. I have included a picture to show what the ads look like. IF the ads bother you, you can spend a bit more money and purchase the version without ads.OVERALL:Overall, for a smart phone in this price range, you can\u2019t go wrong. Although the video quality and speaker could be a bit better, you can\u2019t expect much more from a smartphone in this price range.Please let me know if I can answer any questions about this Smart Phone!",

    "text": "I've had this device for about a week now. If there is anything that comes up that I don't like after a month I will update the review.***Usage***The main thing that's missing in all reviews is how the people are using their device. This device is actually being used as my daily driver. I upgraded from an ever aging galaxy s3 which was rooted with cm 12.***Hardware***I know I know this does not come with a snapdragon 820 or 4 GB of RAM. Is it as fast as a galaxy s7, or a One Plus 3? No. But this costs sixty dollars where as the One Plus 3 costs $400, the s7 costing about $650. In fact if you look up on YouTube this device vs Galaxy S7 speed test, the S7 is barely faster. With my usage the hardware is just fine. The processor is snappy enough. I've had little to no lag. I've experienced no force closes. The 2GB of ram can keep about 5 apps open. And 16 GB of storage is more than enough for me. However, there is a micro SD card slot if 16 GB just isn't enough. The screen is better than my s3 screen. No it's not 4k. It isn't even 1080p. It is a 720p IPS panel. This pannel seems like a very good 720p pannel. Viewing angels are great, and colors seem good enough to me. The pannel is also protected in Gorilla Glass 3 which should offer enough protection for most people. Finally, the build quality is awesome for this phone. I know people will hate me for this but the build quality is better than a Galaxy S5 (However the Galaxy S6, S7, and One Plus 3 all have better build quality). The S5 has plastic edges, this has metal edges. The S5 also has a plastic back. So does this. This is an A+ in build quality for the price. And a B+ in build quality for any price. All in all the hardware for the Blu R1 HD is superb. I'm a geek and I have no problem what so ever with the speed of this phone. If you do basic stuff like Facebook, Instagram, Web Browsing, Music Listening, YouTube, and even games like Candy Crush or Temple Run this phone will do very well. Even more demanding games will do okay. However if you want the best performance, fastest game playing device, this is not for you. Instead look at a One Plus 3, Galaxy S7, or an iPhone 6s.***Cameras****The cameras on this phone are not any where close to as good as an S7, S6, S5, or S4. I would say the back camera does a little bit better than my Galaxy S3. The camera also shoots way fast. I would say the Back camera can snap a picture about as fast as the Galaxy S5 does. The front camera in my opinion is equal to the S5 front camera. And it even has front facing flash so low light quality should be better than the S5 on the front camera. All in all for the price point the camera is excellent, and in general the cameras are okay. I'd give an A+ for the price point, and a B- in general. I will include some sample shots in the pictures section.***Speakers***My biggest complaint about this phone is indeed the speakers. Yes it is a budget phone. No I don't expect these speaker to have good mids, lows, and good bass. However I do expect the speakers to be loud enough. These are anything but loud. Most YouTube videos require you to turn the volume all the way up just to barely here what the person is saying. If you watch movies these should be just fine if you like turning the volume up all the way. In this price range I would give the speakers a B-, and in general a C.***Wifi, Cell Service, and Bluetooth***The wifi is great on this phone. I seem to get the same signal strength out of this device as my mom's S7 does. However on our 100mbps fiber to the home network the S7 would get almost always 110mbps. Where as the Blu R1 HD would get about 37mbps download. The Blu also does not support the 5GHZ band.As for cell service, the Blu worked wonderful on AT&T;'s network. Cell strength was always the same as the S7. The Blu scored on average 61 mbps on AT&T;'s LTe network. I have yet to test my mom's S7. However, in the future I will update this review with the results of my mom's S7. Bluetooth was just like any other device. I could go about 15 feet away from my Bluetooth speaker before music started to get choppy. Bluetooth streaming was also smooth with little delay. There was also no \"choppiness\". All in all for sixty dollars; connection wise this phone gets an A+. And in general a B- (because of the wifi speeds).***Call Quality****Call Quality is just like a flagship from 2012. There is no HD Voice. There is no Voice over LTE. And there isn't even support for Wi-Fi Calling. However, calls were always loud enough, and sounded just the same as my Galaxy S3. I also received no dropped calls. All in all for the price point, call Quality is an A-. And in general, a B-.***Software***The software on the Blu R1 HD is nearly stock Android. The only differences I could see was that Blu does not use the Google Now Launcher. And there are some extra display, and sound settings. There is also a separate Gallery app. And the camera UI is tweaked. The software always runs smooth, and is very fast and fluid. There is also no bloatware, except for the Google apps.If you get the Amazon Prime version, you will also have Amazon's apps preinstalled.You will also have ads on the lock screen which I personally do not mind at all. I have no complaints about the software, and I'd wish all budget phonrakers would take the Stock Android software approach.***Updates***Many people say BLU does not have a good history for updating their devices. This is true; however, I've already received two software updates in the two weeks I've had this phone.***Final Verdict***In my opinion there is no better phone you can get at this price point. If you don't do a lot of heavy gaming this phone is a much better choice than forking out $650 plus for an S7. I would also only buy the 16GB and 2GB RAM model if only because in this day and age that is the minimum.****FINAL Updates****Okay I know it's been a long time. But I need to update this review. I dropped a star. If only because there were a few issuee that pushed me to buy a flagship after 6 months (Galaxy Note 5). Number one was Bluetooth. At first, Bluetooth was just fine, as stated above in my first review. However, now my Bluetooth is always failing to connect. The only way to fix this is turning Bluetooth off, and then restarting the phone. The second issue I just could not stand was how quiet the rear firing speaker is. It is very very quiet to the point where you will need an external audio source. The final issue I have is the spyware that was found on the phone. The spyware would sentd various data to a company in China. However, BLU did push out an update to fix this. Speaking of updates, before switching to the Note 5, I had received about 6 updates. All of which were only a month behind Google's current monthly security patch. I also forgot to mention in my original review about the battery life. From my memory battery life was great for the price point. It had even better battery life than my Note 5 I have right now. With brightness turned up 25% most of the time I got around 4 hours of screen on time on average. Thanks for all the up votes everyone!",

    "text": "I bought this Blu R1 HD - 16GB with Prime exclusive offers for my father. My father is retired and on social security. He neither can afford or want an expensive phone. So I looked at Blu having bought Blu Studio Energy 2 one and half year ago for my wife .who refused to buy any top brand phones since in her words \"they are too expensive and end up breaking in year of two anyways\".This phone came up first on list. After reading some reviews and comparing specs I decided this will be good enough phone for my father. For what he wants to do on phone which is make calls, read news and watch YouTube, this is a great phone.One thing I want to say first is, special offers you get on lock screen are not too intrusive. Even my father who is very picky about everything, has not said anything about it being there.Pros:Price - I mean come on that's the reason we are all here.Feels and looks great.Very responsive.It feels almost as fast as my Samsung galaxy 6S edge.Decent amount of storage with ability to expand.Dual sim. Perfect for any international traveler.Cons:I understand this is a cheaper model because it suppose to receive special offers from Amazon and like I said they aren't even that intrusive. What I don't like about this phone is it has plethora of Amazon apps which can not be removed to save storage. May be in future they will make one Amazon app not removable that needs for sending special offers and all others can be removed if not needed.Battery is not removable - that's ok with me since it seems to be new trend. However this phone requires you to remove back plate it order to insert sim and SD card. I mean if there is going to be back plate why not make battery removable as well.Overall a great phone for $60. I will definitely suggest this phone to any of my friends and family.PS: That Blu Studio Energy 2 I bought for my wife I mentioned up top it is working just fine. Blu is a reliable company will definitely do business with them again.If this review helped you, please click on \"Yes\" button down below. Thanks.",

The ads are hardly noticeable and can be swiped off (they'll return after you lock and unlock) \u2014 I've already been desensitized and prepared for Idiocracy. The phone so far (after 3 weeks + another family members use of a similar phone) is reliable. With a case, it does well with being dropped. My relative owned this same phone and only upgraded because they broke it by sitting on it in their pocket. Otherwise, they'd have kept it as it allowed them to play games endlessly, and to use Facebook.I'm familiar with BLU Phones and routinely come back to them. Their camera's aren't the best but are \"up there\" as decent enough. No one complains about hearing me and I don't struggle to listen \u2014 I say this as someone who is easily distracted by competing sounds. The GPS is great. The screen is HD and beautifully clear. Apps run smoothly. Every so often I've noticed on BLU specifically, on any operating system, it has issues with managing large bodies of text. It will skip back and forth, inputting text in the wrong place and making conversations a hassle \u2014 in particular on FB. I say BLU specifically because I've owned many phones but somehow BLU is the only phone that routinely behaves strangely with text.My only peeve is the lack of useful built in alarms to wake me \u2014 a personal issue that is easily remedied through customization. I just find they don't get loud enough or the Alarm app won't go even off in spite of having the countdown in the overview \u2014 I don't attribute this failure to BLU Phones as I have had MANY phones fail me by that regard.Sometimes they have issues but at their price, I can't say no. Why pay $600 for a similar phone?",

Nothing to complain.-  Amazon ads are not too disturbing, they are similar to regular notifications on your lock screen (sometimes full size)- Very close to stock android (runs 6.0)- Battery life is very good (1 full day with normal usage)- Performance is impressive for it's price point.- Expandable memory- Dual sim card slots (micro)Minuses:- Cameras (front and back) are poor. Offnote front camera too has a flash which is nice.- No gesture controls- Back of the phone looks pretty bland (you can manage with a case but BLU case which is available in amazon for $6.99 is bulky and you lose the look of the phone)- Power button and volume down button are too close. Texture of these buttons are same, so I often get confused and change ringtone volume (volume down) when switching off the screen.All in all it's a very good smart phone especially for the price.I definitely recommend R1 HD especially to elders or who don't care about cameras.",

The display looks good with pretty good brightness and the battery life is ok, not great, but gets the job done. It's build quality is really nice too. The Amazon apps that are built in are great if you have a prime membership. It's even gotten me to look at things that I haven't really used like prime music and the free Kindle books. My only really issue with this phone is that I dropped it once about two weeks after I got it and it cracked right down the center of the screen. It still works fine, as I'm writing this review on it, but it looks like there is a hair running across the screen. Up until the point that this phone cracked I had never cracked a cell phone screen ever and I've never put a case on any phone that I've owned. The screen does appear to be scratch resistant though so that's a plus. I'd probably recommend getting a case for it though. Then again, it's only $60 to replace it, so it's not like cracking the screen is killing my wallet that much. This phone is definitely a good buy if you're like me and you want solid function but don't want to pay the ridiculous prices of the flagship phones. It's also unlocked, so if your carrier has a sim card, you just pop it in and that's all you need to do to switch phones. It's got a second sim card slot too if you want to rock two different carriers. Probably pretty handy for people who travel to Europe.",

    "text": "Update:  The phone's still going great after six months.  I'm super happy with it.  Original review follows:After having my 1.5 year-old Samsung phone and tablet die within weeks of each other, I decided I'd had enough of high dollar devices that were locked and had tons of bloatware, etc. etc.  So I was happy to find this device for $110ish for the premium (2GB RAM/16GB storage) no-ad version. For me personally, the ads would be a little too soul sucking so I went with the no-ad version. I was a little nervous to try something so different, but I figured what the heck for such a low price.I've been using this for about 2 months now, and so far I'm delighted with the purchase.  The unlocked, stock (I think) android is far superior to the Samsung/AT&T; version.  I can add/remove whatever apps I want on it, and it blazes in comparison to any Samsung I've used, as well as other phones I've tried over the years.  Note that I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to that aspect of it, but I'm otherwise a pretty heavy phone feature user, and this thing holds up extremely well in terms of speed and stability.My quick rundown:-Phone calling features are excellent, definitely preferable to the AT&T;/Samsung version-Wifi is solid, but no 5G if that matters to you-Screen quality is fine for pictures and video, but I would say not super high quality.  I find it acceptable for most purposes-Both regular and speakerphone speakers are OK, but plan to generally use bluetooth or headphone speakers-Camera is decent in good light, but poor in low light-Screen glass is susceptible to scratching so get a protector-Power and volume buttons are a little too low profile for me, but I do have big fingers-Battery life so far is fantastic.  I can get through a full day and still have ~30% or more depending on usage.-Again, overall speed and stability are greatMy general attitude with this phone is that if I get a solid year out of this, I'll be extremely pleased given the price.  I'm for sure done with contract phones from here forward.  If you're on the fence like I was about jumping ship from contract phones, I can tell you that, at least for me with this phone, the grass truly is greener on the other side.",

I don't dislike windows phones, mind you, but the app environment is more than lacking and the phones (while very cheap) become outdated pretty fast. When this phone came out, I thought it was too good to be true. Lucky for me, and for her, it isn't.Photo Quality:Not the best. I tried to instal the Google Photo app, but it doesn't work properly on this phone. I don't mind playing around with more advanced apps, but my mom isn't the most tech savvy, so I just let her stick with the stock app. It's meh. Low light is wanting, video quality is good, and outdoors with good light actually does yield really great results! While not the best, its a HUGE upgrade from what she had. Not to mention that it actually has a flash!Feel:It feels pretty good! Its about the same size/weight as my Nexus 5x and the plastic backing feels about the same as well. It doesn't feel like a cheap toy, like her Lumia, and the gorilla glass on the front is a huge improvement over whatever plastic covering was on her old phone.Speed/Quality:For $50, its fantastic! You definitely get WAY more than you pay for. The ads aren't really invasive, easy to swipe away, and having android 6.0 is such a pleasant experience. The biggest caveat is the bloatware. I really, really wish I could uninstall some of the redundant calendars, calculators, etc. Ads I can understand, but I dont see myself or her using the Amazon Calculator/calendar/Alexa/Photos/Etc.With that said, its very responsive, very quick and it doesn't leave me feeling like it could be better. I'm very surprised at the overall quality that I got for such a low price.Overall:This is a great phone! I've bought things on the cheap from Amazon before. Wasn't to enthused by their Kindle. It was great, but using it really did make you feel like you using a cheap device. The Blu R1 doesn't give you that feeling. You really feel like you got away with murder for paying so little for such a good phone. I'm definitely a fan and if anyone else in my family is looking to upgrade without breaking the bank, I plan to recommend this phone.",

I don't play games on my phone any more like I used to in high school so I don't need a gaming machine, although this phone should manage well with most games. Really, all I do is use the basic social media apps popular nowadays, Snapchat and Facebook pretty much, YouTube, and an assortment of legal music apps to stream music like Spotify and other less known apps. Additionally I text and talk, obviously. I don't need a crazy nice camera, but just something that gets the job done when I \"need\" to take pictures for something important and maybe send them. Obviously this phone can execute all of these tasks perfectly fine as could most midrange or higher phones of the last 5 years. Well, I just broke my beloved Flex 2 phone this week and obviously I was not going to go for the iPhone 7 or even anything above $300! At $60 and seeing the reviews I thought, sure why not. I definitely don't regret the purpose by any means and also love the fact that I won't be putting a phone around the case to protect as I normally would with more expensive phones. Construction is very well made with the phone rounding at the edges and metal on the sides. The back is a rubberized plastic and I'm content with it. I'm not expecting some hard metal or glass at this price. BLU and Amazon have outdone themselves with this deal. I installed a weather app right away and I pretty much just have one small little ad when I turn on the lock screen of the phone which barely catches my attention as I quickly swipe the phone into the home screen.I was contemplating originally on getting the MOTO G as I did have the Moto X (2013) and loved it. I saved $90 and can't say I regret it. I don't think I would have regretted either choice, but I wanted to see just how much I could get out of a $60 and this is very impressive.",

I'd read reviews saying the R1 HD was underpowered and such, but I'd owned a BLU Life One previously and I didn't have any issues with that phone, so I decided to give this one a try. So far, I couldn't be happier. Coming from a Microsoft Lumia 640XL, I expected this phone to run a bit slower loading apps, etc.. I am pleasantly surprised by how wrong I was about that assumption. This phone is a fair bit smaller than the 640XL,which makes typing on it a little more difficult, but not enough to really matter. The one issue I have with typing is the curved edges of the screen. While the screen looks amazing, the curved edges do not sense touch... So if you're trying to touch something at the very edge of the screen, it doesn't register. most of the time this isn't a huge issue, it only becomes a problem when you're trying to edit text in a form field and the text it at the edge of the screen.Overall, everything about this phone has been excellent. The build quality is solid, the battery life is great (I've never been left with anything less than 10% after a full day of use, including an hour of Facebook Live streaming), and applications open quickly and run flawlessly. My only suggestion is that you spend the extra $10 to pick up the 16GB version, as this also doubles the RAM to 2GB.As far as \"bloatware\" goes, yes, this phone has a bunch of Amazon bloatware pre-installed that you can't remove. (If you spend the $100/$110 for the ad-free version, you don't get the Amazon bloatware.) However, I tend to use most of the \"bloatware\" applications anyway, being a Prime member, so I don't mind those apps being installed. (It's also nice to have the ability to watch Prime Movies on my phone, although I rarely do so.)I would recommend this phone to anyone, especially previous Android users who may not be willing to pay upwards of $500 for the latest Samsung phone but want similar performance for day-to-day use. The only people who may not find this phone useful are extreme power users and people who play graphically-intensive mobile games. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can't beat this deal.",

My low expectations were immediately shattered as soon as I opened the box this thing is great. It feels nice in your hand, display is crisp and easy on eyes, operation is snappy, setup was simple and straightforward(I was up in less than 5 min) ads are totally unobtrusive. It's my knee jerk reaction to device. I have only had for a day so I will update review after living with it for a while.  For what it's work I'm a tech guy and see a lot of hardware. The build and feel are great even for a product at 3-4 times the price.The only thing that I can really ding it for is you pretty much have to put a case on it. Camera sticks out as does curved glass screen(which is really well done)  So I can't put it down without some angst of scratchin. But so far I haven't really wanted to put it down anyway.Long and short. BUY ONE you won't be disappointed. I wanted it as a backup for my droid turbo. And my turbo became the backup.I stick with my original review. I have had to turn it off and back on again once since I've had it to fix some buggy behavior. That being said, it is something I have had to do with every computer I've ever owned. (Yes your phone is a computer)",

But for the price, it sure is hard to complain.  Do yourself a favor and get the 16GB/2GB variant.  The extra device storage and RAM are WELL worth the extra $10.  Also, don't bother buying the phone thinking you can disable the lockscreen advertisements.  As of yet, the bootloader is locked and the phone is not rootable.  Trying to disable the lockscreen app also does not work.  BLU and Amazon has patched the workaround.  Also, installing a 3rd party lockscreen does not work.  You'll end up \"unlocking\" the device twice.  Honestly, the ads aren't so bad.  Maybe in the future, Amazon will allow people who bought this device to upgrade to an ad free experience like on the Fire tablets.",

    "text": "WOW! WOW!! WOW!!!I wanted a second, inexpensive backup phone that I could take to places I work where phones occasionally get taken or where it's simply easy to lose them.  Having an Iphone 6 plus, that had made me nervous.  So I got the $60 version with ads, 2G RAM, 16 GB storage and I added a 64GB samsung (EVO Class 10) micro SD ($20) card to crank the storage up to 80GB. Finally, for another $7, I threw in the BLU R1 HD armorflex case also made by Blu.And  I am simply BLOWN AWAY!!!  First of all, this thing just looks so classy and high end.  Beautiful and way nicer than phones costing much, much more.  The screen is simply amazing.  Gorgeous with great brightness (seems higher than the listed 420 NITS - it's BRIGHT), eye-popping vibrant colors, deep contrast and great pixel density - ppi.  They don't list the PPI but doing the math and comparing to an IPHONE 6, this has roughly 90% of the pixels/density vertically and horizontally.  So not 100%, but to my eyes, I can't see that small a difference and simply cannot discern pixel structure.On STORAGE - definitely spend the $10 bucks (cheap!) for 16GB storage and the 2GB ram.  This comes with Android Marshmellow and as a result, I was able to convert the Samsung microsd to internal storage and have had ZERO issues with any applications installed that way.  You truly get (almost) 80 GB to play with this way.  I have put in a ton of audio, and it all streams great via blue tooth.On PERFORMANCE - I installed ASPHALT 8 and REAL RACING 3 and there were NO LAGS on this thing at all - which shocked me, especially given that I am using the microsd as internal storage. It's a low spec processor but I think they have all been such overkill (mostly) for a long time that even a low end processor does surprisingly well.  I DO THINK that a key element is having the 2GB  RAM for running apps (again, spend the $10).CASE - there are no other good options at the moment but I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this $7 BLU case looks and feels.  It looks high end, reasonably slim and appears to give great protection. Way nicer than I expected.CARRIER/4G/LTE (updated 7/18/16) - I have T-mobile in the Dallas area.  I popped my SIM from the iphone 6 plus in to the BLU (with a $7 nano-micro adapter) and after a power down and restart, it had no problem connecting to the network at 4G speeds (LTE connection has been hit or miss).  I have found in the Dallas area T-Mobiles 4G is everywhere but the LTE is not, so when I have LTE on in my iphone, the phone sometimes struggles with switching back and forth between LTE and 4G and I have actually found more reliable results keeping it in 4G (Dallas/Tmobile/Iphone - your mileage may vary) - both in terms of coverage and speed (the speed being hampered by the intermittent LTE coverage and perhaps greater usage saturation).  I just did an OOKLA speed test in my backyard, and I got 35.4Mbps downstream and 6.8 up with it only being 4G connected.  Those are really good 4G speeds, but as noted in the specs, they don't support all the 4G/LTE bands.  If you want to use Verizon or Sprint, this phone won't work.  Important consideration. Lastly, HOTSPOTTING (critical for me) works GREAT!ADS? - I wanted cheap so went with the offers/ads version.  You can always pay the $50 later to remove them.  Its a bit different.  Every time you turn on the phone, there's a static amazon ad on the screen.  But that's it.  Swipe up to unlock and it's gone until you turn off/on again later.  I actually am surprised by how non-big-deal it is and am hardly noticing it any more.  But if this became my main phone later, I could see spending the $50 to remove them.  Maybe.CAMERA - From what I have found, this is THE ONLY NEGATIVE on the phone when COMPARED TO HIGH END PHONES.  The camera sucks a bit.  In really great light, it's not too bad, though still tends a bit to blurring if you don't keep your hand real still, but not too bad - though detail and focus NEVER seems to be really great.  In lower light, pictures are much poorer.  Of course, this is all relative.  When compared to my iphone 4 back in 2011, this is a  decent camera - probably comparable to that phone (just looked at some old photos from that one).  It has a higher MP (8 vs 5) than that phone, but the detail, colors and focus are no better than it - again, maybe comparable.  It certainly can't hold a candle to the optically stabilized and premium quality camera in my iphone 6 plus.  If having a really decent camera in your pocket with your phone is important, then this would probably be the deal breaker.  The only one.  But it's real.  Haven't figured out yet how much I care about that.SPEAKER (updated 7/18/16) - I originally didn't care about this because I don't listen to music playing through my iphone speaker....ever.  However, realized today that the biggest issue with the speaker may be it's placement on the back.  This speaker is also used for the ringer and when it is lying flat on a table in its case (as it often is), the speaker becomes REALLY difficult to hear if there is any background activity.  It certainly would not be ideal, either, when using it for a speaker-phone conversation (prop the device up?) but the ringer thing is pretty significant.  I have now taken to laying the phone on its face....but that's far from ideal.  FRANKLY, this is a really bad placement design on an otherwise extraordinarily well designed phone....someone didn't test this one enough.OVERALL, though, I am pleasantly stunned.  For $87 (with the memory card and case; not counting cost of a SIM), I end up with a beautifully styled 4G phone with a gorgeous display, great performance, 80GB of storage for all the apps and media I want to carry....which won't completely break my heart and wallet if I lose it.  AMAZING!  Would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone (using ATT/T-Mobile/Cricket) looking to save a lot of $ but still wanting a great smart phone experience.  Do spend $10 for the increased RAM/storage and then get a GOOD quality micro SD card if you tend to load up a lot of media or apps - though 16GB will do for a lot of folks. WOW! WOW!! WOW!!!",

If you're being honest with yourself the Amazon endorsement sealed your purchase. You saw what a runaway hit the Kindle Fire for $50 was so you expected it again even if the phone wasn't made and branded by Amazon. Well you were right, good performance, a great quality IPS screen ( surprisingly good actually), the benefit of Android 6.0 to increase the base storage and gorilla glass. Yes, at this price it's a steal. It's a good phone, for the kids, grandparents and a backup for tech enthusiasts and multi sim travellers. The bonuses are a promise to the next version of Android from Blue (Something I'd say to ignore, in most cases if you're buying a cheap Android phone buy it for what it offers now not the promise of what it may have in future), which might happen because this phone has been get the monthly Google security updates as of September 2016.

    "text": "So, I was a little worried to get this phone because of all of the negative reviews, but I'm glad that I did (have used it for three months). I bought the no-ads version with 16GB storage and 2MB ram. It runs fine. I got the update after the big security scare with China and it was still fine after that. There are some problems with it. I have some trouble getting the files to show up on my computer when I plug it in via USB. It never works the first time, but usually does on the second. The area near the sim card gets hot, but the battery doesn't. During the summer, I made sure to be careful because I read one review that said it blew up and I'm guessing it's because it got too hot. I use the phone overseas on 3G. Sometimes, I need to turn the phone off to get it to connect to the 3G network. Initially setting it up to connect was difficult because of the 3G, 3G/4G options. My network supports both, the phone supports both, but my sim card only supports 3G, so it took some tinkering -- again this is on an overseas network. I think the camera is good and it records videos nicely. Of course, there are better phones for taking pictures and video, but with multiple tries, I do get nice shots, even with indoor lighting, just using the built in camera app. I don't have a case for it, but I'm pretty careful. I have not dropped it, but it has fallen over a few times. I did not get a screen protector and after 3 months of everyday use, there is not a scratch on it. The screen glass is pretty durable. Again, I am careful with this phone. The one problem I did have at first was with the sim card 1 slot. For some reason, I kept getting a \"no sim card\" message. I switched to sim card 2 slot and don't have the problem anymore. I do not use the phone to talk very often, but haven't really noticed any issues with actually using it as a phone. It plays Pokemon Go just fine.I know others have had issues with this phone. Maybe those issues have been fixed at this point.",

    "text": "I had originally purchased this phone for my brother who had been without a phone, his phone was being repaired and he needed something to hold him over for about a month or so. The Blu R1 HD did that and more! After his phone was fixed he sent me the R1 back and I had originally intended to keep it as a backup but soon found myself using it over my Nexus 5.The first thing that stuck out to me was the screen quality, it felt phenomenal touching it and feels like it gives a better image quality on everything I'm viewing. However, the biggest surprise was the battery life, it lasted me well into two days with fairly moderate use (checking text messages, email, google searching, occasional phone call). Compared to my Nexus 5 that was night and day difference. I had initially thought the ads that show up on the lock-screen would be cumbersome and annoying, that hardly proved to be true. I barely noticed them and in most cases I was unlocking my screen so quickly it wasn't even on my radar. The phone also has dual sim-card capabilities and is micro-sd card capable (another thing my Nexus 5 lacks). The hardware in this phone is outstanding, especially for this price point, perfect for social media use, basic gaming and multitasking.One of the major cons I had with this phone was the lack of quick charge, I own 3 different quick charge units and none of them worked on this phone. While that wasn't much of an issue as the phone didn't take long to charge normally and the battery life was beastly anyway, it would have been nice to have. Also the camera seems average at best, at this price thats pretty much expected though, sacrifices had to be made somewhere and it kinda shows there. The camera worked fine for me in daily use but then again I'm not a quality freak with pictures and video.Pros:Quality screenLong battery lifeMicro SD expandableThe hardware. Quad-core processor, 16GB storage and 2GB of RAMTwo SIM card slotsCons:Lack of quick chargeCamera is just averageThe Blu R1 HD is a titan of a budget phone. Its extremely hard to find a quality phone for under $200, let alone under $100. The R1 gives you the performance of a $200 even $300 phone for a fraction of that. While I'm still debating on rolling with the R1 or my Nexus 5 I can't question the profound quality of the deal that is offered here.This phone bridges so many gaps, it could be the first smartphone for a parent or grandparent who is leaving their flip-phone behind, or a kid who is now old enough to have their first cellphone. It could be the perfect back up phone, media streamer or mp3 player. But most of, with its quality hardware at budget price, it could be an every day phone for even the most discriminating cell phone user.",

It works really smooth, I loaded kindle with my book opened where I was reading it on the tablet. Nice, tiny, but nice. I could read it on this phone for a bit, if no tablet (10.1 inch) was there. Videos loaded awesome, amazon's, NJPW world's, youtube's, bestrussiantv.com's. All load instantly. I know it's cause it's so new, but still.. 2 gigs of ram do make a difference. One annoying thing, I inserted my micro SD, so it asked me if I'd like to use it for apps and all. I did, so it made me format it. I connected to PC to back up the music and ebooks on it, the default driver didn't work. I had to manually search for the driver on my PC. The second MPT driver did work. They need to fix it, it should load it by default. Still I backed up my stuff, formatted, put it back on. Everything works. The speaker IS OK, they who complained don't understand that each app has it's own volume... I guess after many android devices it's just easier for me. I plan to wifi call as much as I can to stretch those 500 minutes for 60 days. With comcast, wifi is all over, and doesn't cost to use. I tested the phone with hangout's dialler, worked well, where wifi signal was strong. I love this phone so far, just ordered a case for it.",

While it is a bang-for-the-buck device, as a consumer I am more concerned with true usability.Here is my review:After a few months of use, this phone still works well... MOST OF THE TIME. I have run into many stuttering issues in simple daily tasks. If you are patient enough for some blank screens, this will not affect you. Another issue I had was with the phone overheating. With most BLU phones this is not an issue thanks to a removable battery; but this phone's battery is not removable, so now I have to bring the company into the mix. On the brighter side of that issue, BLU has great customer service, so the issue is getting resolved as I type.My final point is this: if you can spare the change, save for the BLU Life One X2 mini. It is a far superior device for only $90 more. If you can't, this phone will last you until a point in which you can afford the upgrade. (Or suck it up and partake in the oh-so-cursed CONTRACT)",

That is not really the case. It comes preloaded with some Amazon apps but if you use prime, you will most likely use the apps anyway. Some cons are the camera. it's an 8 mega pixel in the rear, which is ok. Most flagships have a better camera now. The speaker is not the best, but if you use headphones you will be perfectly fine. The screen is not as vibrant as new AMOLED screens but it does the trick. Some pros are the battery life. It lasts forever under heavy data usage. It is not fast when you charge it but if you plug it in at night you will be just fine. Every other feature has worked flawlessly. It's worth the price tag, as a main phone or a back up.

    "text": "Similar to the kindle line of tablets and ebooks this phone contains ads on the home screen when you wake or power on the device. The only addition is that ads may show up on the notification screen also. You will not be spammed with notifications, as their either a small wallpaper ad or a single notification bar (that's .25 to.5 larger than the regular notifications, but does not spam you with multiple) that changes from time to time when you wake up or device. Even if you download a lock screen app/widget, the ads still show up after you bypass the lock screen and still needs to be swiped away. By installing a third party lock screen there will be additional swipes required which may be a waste of your time. So unless you're a software engineer and able to root or reconfigure the whole OS, there's no simple way around it or of that I'm aware of unless you purchase no ad variant.The ads they give you are personalized suggestions based on your browsing history, so it might be a good tool to have if you're an avid Amazon shopper or have a lot of disposable income and want to keep up to date with what's out there based on your purchasing history. If you accidentally click on an ad it's not a automatic purchase or will give you spam/a virus. It will direct you to Amazon's website where you have the option to see the product summary and add to your cart. Additional login is required (unless you save password) which is child friendly if you were to give the phone or have your kid borrow the phone to pay games or use apps.The phone itself is a lot higher quality than what you pay for. It's not the best phone out there, but it's capable of doing everything they can do, but with less flare. By this I mean screen resolution, speakers, and camera is not the best quality out there, but also not the worst. If you just need a phone that can do all the basics and don't care about owning latest and greatest flagship phones out there this may be the product for youI like to compare this to the Nexus 5 that came out late 2013 as it has similar specs. It's not exactly the same as in 3 years the standard has changed and there's a lot of features from the BLU R1 that stands out namely the expandable storage, Dual SIM and better front facing camera. The Nexus 5 is still usable today as the OS is up to date with Android 6.0 marshmallow. The BLU R1 also have this OS, but I am not aware if google will support 7.0. If not, Android 6.0 should still be relevant for a few years until 8.0 or 9.0 comes out.Price point: Again very good budget phone for the specs which I will be going intoDisplay: The display is very good for a 5inch phone. It's not an AMOLED display, but the slightly curved corners does help with viewing angles especially in direct sunlight. The curve corners are not as predominate as the edge series on the Samsung Galaxy line or does it have actual function, but it does help see the screen better from the side and makes the phone look more streamline in its design. Also the slightly curved design make long swipes from left to right (or vice versa) very natural without much stop gaps in motion and also feels more comfortable to hold in the handHardware: Has 2GB of ram which is capable of handling multiple apps running at the same time. Everything runs very smooth with no slow downBattery: Good enough to last the whole day of decent use. Maybe more due to the doze feature in Android 6.0 especially if you don't check your notifications, go on social media or play games constantly. Although the back cover is removable, the battery isn'tCamera: The rear camera is only 8MP which is pretty decent for today's standards. Pictures aren't blurry and you can make out most of what you're shooting. Unless you're a professional photographer or nit picky about pixel density in your photos I do not think you'll be criticized on your photos if you post it to social media. Front facing camera is very good 5MP with wide angle lens and flash. Excellent if you're into taking selfies.Internet connection:  Supports 4G LTE. I have no issues with it thus far, works as expected. Wireless works as expected also.Sound. You just get stereo coming from the back of the device, nothing really to write home about. It's very decent and you will not hear any distortion in sound at low or max volume. It's good that they place it in the back as some phone companies put it on the bottom near the charging port where your hands/fingers may block off the speakers when you play apps that require to hold the phone horizontally which kills the experience/immersion of the gameStorage: There's an optional 64GB microSD card card storage which is great if you have  a lot of photos, videos and documents that you don't want to black up in the cloudDual SIM and Unlocked: Like the Nexus 5 it can be used for any carrier. I like the dual SIM feature as it's great for those who want to separate their business and personal contacts and/or those who travel globally and use different networks. It keeps everything organized instead of having to swap out sim cards or owning multiple phones. Note that this phone uses micro sim and not nano sim cardsVibration on the device is really strong, and it feels like it may damage the phone overtime (?). I suggest turning off the 'vibrate on touch' option in settings as it can be overbearing at times.The volume and power button are placed very oddly, as the power or wake button is under the volume rocker instead of on top which may be awkward to use if you're familiar with it being the other way around. It does that time to build the habit as I tend to press the volume up button at times when I meant to hit the sleep/wake/power buttonThe device has the Android 6.0 marshmallow operating system, but with ad support and has all Amazon based apps per-installed. There's a delete all task feature presented by a circular sweep brush icon that will delete all open programs/apps in your recent apps drawer. This will be present in Android 7.0 but glad it's a feature on this phone while running on Android 6.0Who is this phone for?1. Great for those on a budget2. Those who broke their phone and or crack their phone's screen before the 2 year contract ended and need an affordable replacement until the contract renews3.  Those who want to just in essentials and don't really care about high end specs.4. Great for your parents (may be of older generation) who are not in tune with technology and just want a basic smart phone that does everything. I personally got this for my father who's upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. So far he's loving the new streamline material design5. Parents who may want their kids to have lower cost phone due to budget reason or worried that their kids may lose or break an expensive phone.6. For kids who want to use a phone instead of a tablet at home and not necessary need a phone plan. Like how the ipod touch line used to be (still is?)Overall very good budget phone with excellent specs for the price point, you just have to deal with some ads which can be easily ignored when you want to.",

I put a prepaid SIM card in it and it works like a champ.I was concerned that the ads would be obtrusive, but I haven't even noticed them. They only appear on the lock screen and one of my apps inadvertently blocks them anyway. Other users have said the data use by the ads is minimal and that appears to be true.The one thing I found surprising and didn't like is that there's no compass sensor! I wanted to use an astronomy sky app, but alas no. GPS navigation still seems to work fine.In short, it's well worth the $60 price.",

    "text": "So, I got this because I was looking to switch from Windows phones over to Android and wasn't looking to spend too much. I wasn't expecting too much, but this thing delivered!The screen looks great, the curved gorilla glass is very pleasant to touch and look at. The back is slightly rubberised, making it quite easy to hold onto. The back camera isn't as good as I'm used to, but it's perfectly serviceable. The front camera is much better than I'm used to, as most phones skimp out on the selfie cam. It has a decent processor with enough RAM to run many apps side by side, and still be very responsive. Like others have said, the deals from Amazon are unobtrusive and totally worth the $50 discount. One thing I would like to note is that it takes Micro SIM cards, not nano! If you're switching phones, make sure you have the right size SIM card!UPDATE: One thing I would like to note to anyone interested in Pokemon GO, this phone's orientation does not appear to be precise enough to use the AR feature of that game, and also cannot use the power saving feature of that game due to it also being dependent on orientation. It can detect upright or sideways for all other purposes, though.UPDATE 6/24/17I've had this phone for almost a year now, and although I am upgrading to a more powerful phone as I type this, this little thing has served me well. This was my entry into android coming over from Windows phones. As I've become more familiar with Android and start requiring more from my phone, this one is falling behind. I'd still highly suggest this to anyone that is looking for a budget option, as you get way more than you pay for with this.",

    "text": "I needed a replacement phone and wanted to try out Android. I'm a big Apple guy and have been using iPhones for years. I'm part of the entire Apple ecosystem with macbooks, ipads and apple tvs. However for all that I'm locked in, I was curious about Android and how well it worked. I found this phone on several blogs and wanted to see it for myself.For the price that Amazon offers, this phone cannot be beat. Yes there are ads on the lockscreen every time you pick up your phone, but it's not too intrusive. The build quality is really nice, the screen is a good size and the form factor is great. It feels really good in your hand. I dropped it on to the floor from a distance of about 1 foot and the screen cracked. I dont think this would happen on iPhone (:P), but I was a little disappointed. The crack isn't huge and I can live with it. The OS is pretty cool and runs really smoothly on the phone. It feels snappy and responsive. The camera quality is pretty poor compared to an iPhone or probably some of the flagship Android phones out there. Lowlight photography is not great and I go a lot of blurry, grainy photos. The front-facing camera is nicer than my iPhone 6 since it has more megapixels. Other than the camera, I'd say everything else is pretty good and worth the price. You're getting a lot of value out of this device at this price and even though you might see ads, it's a small price to pay. To remove ads it's almost like paying for another phone. Totally not worth it. But if you need a backup phone or something you can toss around and not care too much if it gets cracked, dinged, or broken, this is the phone you need to check out and try!",

    "text": "This is my first foray into Amazon branded phones, though I\u2019m very in like with my kindle fire tablet, so Amazon is already high up on my list of likes.  My previous phone, a little Microsoft phone (which I\u2019ll probably never do again, too many shortcomings of the software compared to Android) was really getting on my nerves due to so many apps not being available for use on it that I missed from my previous Android phone (a Samsung Note.)  But unfortunately, we\u2019re very limited in our budget right now, so going back to a Samsung at cash price was just out of the question.Enter this Blu R1 HD.  My husband had been telling me about this new brand of phone, and then he saw this special deal on Amazon for this phone, so he mentioned it to me.  I checked it out and decided, what the heck?  Let\u2019s give it a try and see.  The worst that could happen is I don\u2019t like it and send it back, right?Once I got it, I was immediately struck by how solid but lightweight it feels.  It just really feels nice in my hands, which are fairly small.  I charged it up first thing, before I did anything else with it.  We use AT&T; prepaid, so once it was charged I inserted the sim chip in it and also my microsd card from my other phone.  Word to the wise, if you want to save anything on that card, copy it first.  You will have to reformat it in the phone to make it work.  When you do the reformat, pick portable, so you can still install apps to your phone\u2019s internal memory.  There are apps, like facebook and messenger, that just refused to work until I did that so they could be on the phone\u2019s memory.  Could be that my card is too old and slow, but that was an issue I had, so I\u2019m mentioning it.  I was almost ready to send the phone back until I did a Google search to try and figure out if I could fix the problem first.The battery life on this phone seems to be pretty average to me.  It lasts me about 1.5 days on one charge, with moderate use of texting, IMing, web browsing, playing solitaire and using the alarms.The screen is gorgeous!  Very clear, very crisp and very vivid.  I love that it goes from side to side on this phone, instead of having so much bezel all the way around.  It makes it seem so much bigger than the 5 inches it is.  I watched Netflix, Hulu and youtube on it, and all are gorgeous.  The HD playback flowed very nicely on the screen, and I could see the initial adjustment when I first started a video in Hulu and it adjusted to HD.  No hiccups at all in the playback.  And the touchscreen is nicely responsive.  I\u2019ve had a few phones that make me want to throw them out the window of my car trying to deal with their touchscreens, but this is thankfully not one of them.It takes really good pictures and video too.  I think the pictures are a lot warmer on this phone than on previous phones I\u2019ve had, which to me makes it look more like reality.  They\u2019re pictures I want to actually look at.The only real complaint I have about this phone, is that it\u2019s so quiet.  The onboard alarms I can barely hear when I\u2019m awake.  They work fabulously, I just can\u2019t hear them.  The sound on Hulu was very quiet, and on Netflix and youtube it was a little louder, but still really quiet.  I would suggest earbuds or headphones, or a wireless speaker, which the sound is fantastic through.I haven\u2019t downloaded it yet, but I used to use an independent alarm clock, and I want to see if that is any louder.  I\u2019ll edit this with a follow up once I do.So far this is a really zippy little phone, with a fantastic screen and I\u2019m really happy that I bought it.  The new Android marshmallow is awesome, making using this phone almost as nice as my desktop computer!  Android really got with the program finally, and made a wonderful budget phone into a very satisfying experience.",

    "text": "As I turn over my BLU R1 HD in my hands, I can't help but marvel. The sleek, minimal form factor with its beveled glass front and aluminum frame give the device a premium feel and appearance. 4G LTE and a 5 inch 720p display are two features hard to come by at this price point of 60 dollars (or 110 for the no-ads version), but are certainly welcome. The 16GB of storage out of the box is surprisingly only taken up by a few apps with little nonsense once you get rid of the Amazon shortcuts. Stock android keeps the device smooth and sensible. I paid 60 dollars for the ads version, and it's absolutely worth it as the ads are non obtrusive and only show up on the lockscreen. I use this device as my backup phone, and I must say it's perfectly usable for that purpose. One notable thing is the battery life: it's absolutely superb given that it doesn't have many energy guzzling components. I can go all day watching Netflix on it over LTE and I'll still have plenty of life to spare at the end of the day. Here are the few areas that it does not perform well in,  however:Camera: Both cameras are awful. Don't bother bringing this on your trips to Yosemite or into the city. It does fine for Snapchat or if you need to send your wife a picture of the couch you are looking to buy. Camera is just there as a courtesy on this device.Display: The display is okay. The resolution is fine, 720p is great for regular usage. The colors are terrible however. Blacks appear as a dark gray. You will notice and it will bother you, but it's pretty much nitpicking at this price point.Speaker: The back speaker is bad. Don't bother with it. Use headphones or another speaker.Ads: The ads are not necessarily a problem. No one likes to have them, but they do allow for the phone to be subsidized and they are not intrusive at all. I don't even notice them at this point.Overall, this is a great smartphone to do smartphone things. You can text your friends, browse social media and the web, watch videos, check email, listen to music, etc. It does these things well and without a hitch. You will only have problems if you expect it to go above and beyond that. The photos taken with this device will not appear on National Geographic. The speaker will not allow you to turn up to your favorite tunes. The device runs smoothly and it will not frustrate you in anyway. This is the most you can ask for 60 dollars (don't bother with the 8GB version; that's a waste). Get one for yourself, your kids, your friends, your parents. Maybe even get two for the fun of it. Finally, a smartphone that's cheap and not a piece of cr*p.",

The 640 met my needs, a telephone and using at WIFI hot spots and at home.However, because Windows Phone is apparently being phased out, I started looking for an Android phone.  I was looking for upgrade to my Windows Phone, but wanted an affordable Android phone with dual SIM cards, a quad-core processor with 16 GB Internal memory and 2 GB RAM.  Dream on, right?Well, when I saw the BLU R1 on Amazon with the specs that I was looking for at $59.99, I took a double take.  In addition to getting more memory and ram, this BLU R1 has a better screen.  The screen is incredible looking.  Because this phone is unlocked, I can use my H2O wireless pay as you go plan simply by putting the H2O SIM card into one of the SIM slots.I hardly noticed the advertisements that allow the smartphone to be sold at such a great price.  Frankly, most of the free Android apps have advertisements that are more noticeable.  I would take this trade in a heartbeat.Because of the dual sim card slots, when I travel, I do not have to take out my US GSM SIM\u2019s card.  This will be convenient and will minimize my misplacing my USA SIM card.  Really, the only downgrade is that the BLU R1\u2019s maximum micro SD card capacity is 64GB.  The Lumia 640 is 128 GB.  This was not an issue for me because I have not exceeded 32 GB yet.Pros:\u2022 Quad-core processor\u2022 16G/2G internal memory/RAM\u2022 Gorilla Glass\u2022 Dual SIM card slots\u2022 Unlocked\u2022 Android 6.0 Marshmallow\u2022 4G LTE\u2022 8MP and 5MP camerasCons:\u2022 lithium battery is built in, i.e., cannot be easily replaced by the user\u2022 I could not find any tempered glass screen protector\u2022 Case choices are limitedThe BLU R1 is a quality \u201cbudget\u201d smartphone that I highly recommend.\u00a0BLU R1 HD - 16 GB - Black - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads",

I see a lot of weird reviews with some odd complaints, but I can only think of a few cons, so let me get them out of the way.Cons:1. Simcard slots - these pins are VERY sensitive. Don' be like me and accidentally bend one because it's not bending back. I attribute this mostly to user error, but I wish they'd been tougher so I could have kept my micro sim.2. Battery charge speed - this phone charges slowly. I don't have an issue since I usually only charge my phone at night, but I know some people use apps (Pokemon Go folks) heavily and drain batteries quickly. I tested this with several racing games (Asphalt 8, Beach Buggy Blitz, NFS No Limits...I have a penchant for racing games) and I killed the battery to 0 in around 3 1/2 hours. Not bad. honestlyPros:Screen - The screen is some sort of Gorilla glass. Not sure if the gorilla's make it or it's made from gorilla's. It's tough. Stays clean and very fingerprint free. I'm an oily bastard, so I props. It also has curved edges that feel great on your thumb/finger when sliding etc. Yes please!Gaming capability - this plays all the games I enjoy (racing games) very well. Good frame rate and load times.Display - This thing is bright. I'd never think this was a 720p phone. It displays colors very vividly.Price - Can't be beatBottom line - THIS IS A GOOD PHONE. I would say this is the cheapest usable phone on the market. I'd be hard pressed to move on to a more powerful phone atm. This is exactly what I needed in my daily driver.",

One inherent issue with it is the sporadic rebooting and Apps vanishing from the screen after a reboot. A little investigation turned up a loose sim card holder.  I had to carefully put tape on the back of the sim card to mate the contacts properly. Since this fix it has performed really well. On the 3rd update now and it is holding up well with no more sporadic reboots or disappearing icons. I encrypted the system for about 2 months and the phone went nuts.  Factory reset and it it is back to good functioning again. Maybe the backdoor is still open and allowed a hack intrusion or something.  I will encrypt it once more in a few weeks and see if it goes nuts again.  The battery is beginning to age a little bit but nothing drastic.  It will run for more than 2 days on a single charge unless I do a lot of videos or web surfing.  For the price, it is an excellent deal.",

I iknow they know this is a problem, becuase after the fact now I see other customers have the same complaint, so they probably know that the driver update is not going to be the solution. This is the only thing thats keeping this phone from awesome. If BLU would admit that this is a design flaw and work to resolve it, it would be a respectful jesture to the customers who took a chance on a new brand. If they ever resolve this issue I would buy 3 more right away, but as it is, I will not. Update: 4/29/17 It appears that out of the BLU, my phone now communicates well with my computer.

    "text": "Wow, Just wow.  I have never come across a phone this cheap with the quality it has.  For 60 dollars this phone has blown phones at the 150 dollar range out of the water.  After having used the Phone for 2 days, I think I have my final thoughts on the device.Pros:Great construction - This phone has a metal shell that makes this phone feel very nice in your hands.  It makes you forget that this phone was even under 100 dollars.Perfect size - I thought that the 5\" display was going to be too small.  I was shocked when I received it as when I held it, it seemed to have been a perfect size.  It is not so small you can not tap anything accurately, but it is not so large you need to use one hand to hold it and another to tap the screen.Speedy OS - Using this phone feels immaculate.  No matter what I do or the workload given, it seems to be able to work smoothly without a hiccup.  Android OS 6 (Marshmallow) makes to phone look and feel modern and provides great speed when using the phone.Curved Screen - When I first saw this, I didn't think much of it as it just seemed unnecessary.  Boy was I wrong. The curved screen allows you to slide your finger off and on the screen smoothly.  This sounds simple but when you are sliding your finger off the sides all day and the sides are sharp edges, it is an unpleasant feeling on your fingers.  The glass is very good quality too, as it is Gorilla brand.  Having had phones in the past with Gorilla glass, these screens do not shatter or scratch without a fight.  It is a very resilient material and I am glad it is on this phone.Dual Sim Card slots - Now I do not use 2 sims cards, I only have the one personal number, however if you are a busy person who usually keeps 2 phones on you but would only like 1, this phone allows you to do that and also lets you choose what sim to use for certain things if you need to limit the capabilities of one.Camera - The camera isn't anything to be excited about but the pictures this phone takes are great for the price.  With a flash both in the front AND the back (some 600 dollar phones don't even have selfie flash) this phone shows that it cares about your picture taking experience.Cons:Slides too much - Whether you set it on the arm of the couch or on the sink you will be bound to find out that this phone loves to slide.  Any surface that is not flat will become a slip and slide.  This also is prevalent when holding the phone as it can slide out of your hand a bit too easy.  Luckily the phone has Gorilla glass.No Gyroscope - This probably sounds like an excuse to whine about the phone, but it can honestly be a hassle when wanting to use it for a few apps.  Since the apps I would use the gyroscope for really aren't all too important, I don't want to dock a star off it.Ads - Okay, so you know that if you get the phone with the offers and advertisements, you are going to have to deal with them.  This is technically a con BUT here's the thing.  These ads are not intrusive to your usage of the phone.  They only show up on the lock screen, where when you have no notifications it will appear on the whole screen, but if you have notifications, it reduces the ads to a notification size as well, which is very nice.  I feared that the lock screen wouldn't show notifications for this reason but they worked around that, so do not fear.Battery life - This phone can last a day on one charge, but you can't use it at all.  If you are an active user of your phone be prepared to charge your phone every 4 to 5 hours.  With the charge bank this can be solved, but alone this phone can not keep itself alive for very long.Overall, this phone is amazing.  There is no point in looking for another one if your budget is about 50 to 150 dollars.  This phone feels smooth and it works smooth.  It is unlocked so you can use it with any provider.  This is a phone to brag about to your friends, and in fact I have to mine since I have had it.  I am excited about this phone and I enjoy using it every day.",

I tried to use the phone as my primary phone but the little things started to add up so I switched to a different phone.Observations:1.) Had to turn off bluetooth scanning in order to enable phone audio when paired with my car. This is no fault of Blu but a Marshmallow bug.2.) I had the phone for 1 day, gave it to my kid to watch youtube, an hour later he handed it back with the screen cracked.  I looked into replacing the screen; its cheaper to just buy another phone.3.) I wear polarized sunglasses and because of this, I can't see the screen when it is on.  I have to take my glasses off to use the phone.4.) While talking on the phone, it has a habit of hitting the mute button during talk5.) Everyone I spoke to over the phone complained they could not hear me and noted it sounded like I was in the bathroom when talking to them6.) The battery is not very good.  It took the phone at least a week to settle down and keep an ok charge during the day.  Normal usage during the day results in the battery being close to dead by the time I go to bed.With all that said, its a good phone for $50 as a temporary phone when traveling or using it as a backup.",

I dislike Android phones in general (due to past experience with a Samsung S4) but this phone at this price point is an absolute steal! She can play all of her games (Pokemon Go, Roblox, Minecraft, watch YouTube etc). As others have said, the ads are not that bad. Its mainly on the lock screen so who cares. We liked it so much, I bought another one for my other kid.Note: We don't have an active cellular line on these phones...we just use them as wifi devices and let them tether off our phones.

I have recently come from an original Moto G which wasn't keeping up with newer apps.  This phone doesn't feel like a $60.00 phone.  It is heavy in the hand and doesn't feel cheap.  The metal accents are nice and the screen is gorgeous.  The glass curves ever so slightly at the edges which gives it a high end feel.  The camera is so so, but it will probably meet most people's needs.  It has gotten me through on a daily basis.  The front flash is a nice feature to have, but tends to blow out the shot.I am using the ad supported version of the phone.  For an extra $50.00 off the price, it is totally worth it.  The ads become a back thought after swiping a few times.  You don't really notice them all that much.  Sometimes they are full screen ads, and other times they are notifications.  Actually, you sometimes see an ad for something that you want anyways or a discount for something good.The real test is going to be battery life, which I expect to last me at least all day.  I need a phone that can go all day and sometimes throughout the night without a charge.  I would love to see this phone in a 4.5 inch version, as I have small hands.All in all, make the jump and you won't regret it.",

After about a day I completely stopped noticing the Amazon ads, they are not intrusive at all. The phone is quick enough to handle everyday activities including Pokemon GO. The software is very close to pure Android. If it were a little larger and had a slightly better camera I would probably use this as a low priced daily driver, but my eyes and hands are both a little strained. Not bad for a basic smartphone with all of the basics covered especially for the price.Tips: Don't sweat internal storage, Marshmallow has you covered with the SD card acting just like onboard memory.Also, get the case Amazon sells made by BLU, its a solid little dual layer cover that feels ridiculously premium, I wish BLU made these for their other devices.",

    "text": "I impulsively preordered this phone two weeks before it was released. Although I debated canceling the order a few days before the release date, I ultimately ended up deciding to pay a little extra for the one-day shipping instead.I have NO regrets. I thought that I was happy with the LG smartphone I was previously using, but there is just no comparison between the two devices.  The BLU R1 HD handles the multitasking I do easily, so I can jump back and forth between the apps I'm using without having to wait for the phone to catch up to me.  The OS takes up just under 6 GB of the 16 GB available on my phone, so I'm glad I didn't opt for the slightly less expensive 8 GB option.  Buyers who do choose to go that route will probably want to have a microSD card on hand because their storage space will be fairly limited otherwise.For text input, the default keyboard is excellent.  It's sensitive but not touchy, and the keys are perfectly sized so I'm not constantly finding myself unintentionally hitting the wrong letters.As far as connectivity goes, I'm extremely pleased to find that this phone works with Tracfone's services.  I purchased a Tracfone SIM kit ahead of time, and was able to transfer service from my previous phone to the R1 HD with relatively little difficulty using the included AT&T;/GSM-compatible micro SIM card.  If you choose to do this, it's important to note that the auto-filled IMEI field on the Tracfone website shouldn't be changed; if you enter the IMEIs associated with either of the R1 HD's SIM slots, you'll receive an error message.The only real concern that I had was that the special offers might be a bit excessive, but they are just as unobtrusive as those available on the Fire tablets with special offers.  Removing the ads does not seem to be an option on the R1 HD if you purchase the discounted version for Prime members, although I still haven't explored this phone thoroughly.I'm hard-pressed to find anything wrong with the BLU R1 HD.  In fact, the only feature I have a complaint about happens to be the power button, which is kind of inconveniently located in the middle of the right side.  With the way it fits in my hand, it would be a bit better if the volume and power buttons had been swapped.  Oh, and the AR feature in Pok\u00e9mon GO doesn't seem to work, so I can't share cute pics of Pok\u00e9mon in the real world like my friends can. Aside from that, though, I'm thrilled with the phone.  I really feel that it was a steal at the price I got it for.",

It runs smoothly and without many hiccups. I only occasionally run out of RAM. It also helps that this device is running nearly stock Android 6.0, except for a few OEM and Amazon additions.CAMERAThe camera is decent. It won't take Pulitzer-winning shots, but it gets the job done. The image output is slightly washed out, and autofocus can be finicky sometimes. Dual flash LEDs also make it much easier to take selfies in low light conditions.STORAGEThis device comes with 16GB of onboard storage, which is plenty when coupled with a decent Class 10 SD card (I have a 32GB Lexar card). Nothing horribly special here.NETWORKINGThis device has nearly full 4G LTE support on my network (AT&T;), and it should work fine on any GSM network. I can generally get 15-20Mbps, which is plenty, but nothing to brag about. My old Fire phone could get nearly 60Mbps on AT&T; LTE.CONSTRUCTIONThis device is built impressively well. It has a sleek body, with high-quality glass on the front which curves into an aluminum frame. There is a plastic cover on the back which covers the SIM cards and SD card slot.This device feels heavy in the hand (a plus for me), and feels like a well-built midrange or flagship phone.BATTERYThe battery on this device initially appears to be about average. I'll post more about this later.Anyway, device is fantastic for the price. I would absolutely buy it again.",

That aside, I'm used to my iPhone 7 screen and this screen size is almost the same. The phone itself is a little sluggish with apps. Even Candy Crush was really laggy.

For a budget phone, it's shockingly amazing! The screen is crisp, YouTube videos look great, it plays display intensive games without any lag! (There's even a warning on a particular water racing game that needs certain processing requirements -which it definitely met) it updates quickly, and it works so well!There are, however, a few little things that I don't like: The Google search bar can't be removed.For whatever reason Google sound search gets buggy when listening for music and gets glitchy.Pok\u00e9mon Go can't use the AR function and when going to pok\u00e9stops they don't turn purple when visited, that being said it's still tracks so much faster than my old phone.It can take two micro sim cards, where I have a nano, so it was really tricky getting an adapter to fit for this phone. After 10 minutes of making it snug- I have 4g LTE!  This phone is very much a higher end phone with a beautiful curved Gorilla Glass HD display which rivals an HTCOne, and feels even more comfortable. It holds a charge for almost two days! And it's a quarter of the price of high end phones.  I am blown away and know that if something unfortunate happens to this phone, repurchasing is cheaper than utilizing my insurance on my other phone: $60 over $114 is a no brainer.I'm still learning this phone, so if I have more to add, I'll update it later.  I just can't believe a quality phone is at this price range (even with Amazon ads on the lock screen, it's not in your face about it)Update November 6, 2016:After figuring this phone out for about a month - here are some things that should be known:The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) Is pretty weak in the bass range, it's a pretty muddy sound. Since I use professional DACs for lossless audio, I really wasn't expecting much. However, it was lesser than I would have expected.However the video quality is a much better story, and so are the photos! The settings for HD need to be tinkered with, changing from four megapixels to eight and the photos are crisp - they're not anything to compare to a high end phone, but compared to the photos I've had with prior phones, it makes a clear difference.The date and time did not update automatically when first installing the SIM card. This caused a lot of issues with apps and updates. Once I figured out how to sync to network time, the apps and games started to perform better than expected.This phone handles updates! I am so impressed, it is always up to date! I haven't had any errors like my last phone. Android 6 is just a dream on this budget phone.It doesn't have a compass: meaning that sometimes the GPS points a different direction for a moment, and AR function games, or 360 photos do not work with this phone.I would still recommend this phone to anyone needing a budget burner, or to people who want to save money instead of spending $300 or more on a high end phone, I cannot believe the prime price for this phone is $60.00 and the Non Prime price is only $150.00. It is shockingly good, and very well made.",

The problem is with the bldg. construction, not my phone, but my old phone had Wifi Calling capability, so I could make and get calls in my office. But this is not an absolute deal breaker.2) The power switch is in the worst possible place, right side edge, center....Everytime I pick up my phone I hit the power button it is extremely annoying. Whoever designed it that way should be fired! But this is not a deal breaker.3) Android 6.1 - some of the changes I do not like, such as the contacts interface....some features are hard to find. But not a deal breaker.4) The battery power drops pretty fast from 100% to 85%, but stays in that range for quite a while. I try to keep most of the apps turned off in the background and only use Wifi when absolutely necessary. But this is not a deal breaker.Here's what I really, really, really like about the phone....1) It is light weight, very slim, and seems well constructed.

If it is terrible I can return it if I can live with it I haven't spent that much. I have literally read hundreds of reviews before I bought the BLU.First I have to says I think this phone has been judged harshly given its price point. It's $59! For that price I think it is a fantastic phone. It has (thankfully) a plain jane Android 6 OS. The processor is plenty fast and the 6.0 use of memory makes it a 60 GB usable phone with a card. Yes the speaker is weak but it is fine in all but noisy environments and if you talk on a speaker phone in a noisy busy place your a jerk anyway. I always use my wired Beats and the sound is excellent. Very good bass and clear sound.PROS:-Stock Android makes it so easy to install apps from the play store on your computer to your phone. It literally took me 15 minutes to install 50 apps.-All the Google subsystem and the Amazon subsystem in one device. So I have access to my entire music library from both plus all the prime videos. Videos play and look awesome.-KODI! (Mic drop!)-OK Google frankly kicks Siri's arse when it comes to accuracy. Still figuring out all it can do.-Screen quality is great. Bigger yet lighter than IPhone.-I have a Kindle Fire and Fire TV stick and this is the best that Amazon has ever worked with Google Play!- Pairs absolutely fine with my 2011 Hyundai Sonata, downloads phone book, and with every other Bluetooth device I have.-Works with my Fitbit and Pebble watch just fine.-The Amazon ads don't bother me in the least. Occasionally see one at lock screen and already dumped widget in the trash.-Plays every game I played with IOS great. No stutter, fast load times. Smooth gameplay.CONS:-The camera is acceptable. The flash is fine but low light isn't great.-The phone isn't recognized by Windows as an MTP device and so I can't side load videos or documents. No big since I really don't watch movies on a 5\" screen. It could have to do with my card being dedicated as memory instead of storage but seems to be a known issue.-It's a $59 phone so don't expect NFC or a fingerprint reader or an AMOLED screen. It also doesn't appear to support Bluetooth low energy.-It isn't rooted but appears rootable if you have the tech savvy.-Not the best GPS but it works within a few houses.- Full day battery life with BT and wifi on.

    "text": "Phone arrived today and it's setup and working.  Was very easy.  I went with the Walmart t-mobile SIM kit special (SIM + $30 credit plan) -- T-mobile transferred my number from Sprint in less than two minutes and the new phone was activated and ready.  Google reinstalled my 70+ apps automatically!  Very smooth experience.My first impression is this is a solid phone for the money ($60 w/ Amazon ads).  I'm not a gamer or expecting to watch streaming video -- it's a phone and digital assistant for my needs and it seems a perfect value.  The phone is much more responsive than my previous phone and the cellular data speed I get on T-mobile blows away my old Sprint service. (I am kicking myself for staying on Sprint for so many years)The ads are not obnoxious.  I have a couple of apps with persistent notifications so the ads displayed are small and there is never more than one ad at a time, which can be swiped out of the way.  (See attached pic for example)The battery chargers rather slow and the 1.0 Amp charger which comes with the phone seems inadequate for this battery size.  I have an Anker charger and I will see if it charges faster using that.I purchased a Poetic Revolution Series case with this.  It is specific to this model and fits like a glove.  It includes a plastic screen guard  and the case also protect the camera lens on the back, which otherwise protrudes.  I can lay the phone face up or down and the phone is protected.  If you get this phone, you will definitely want a decent case -- check the case customer reviews before buying one for this phone.Because I only received the phone today, I cannot give you an experienced detailed review yet.  I'll update later with more impressions but, for now, at $60, I don't think you can go wrong with this basic, entry level smartphone.",

    "text": "I bought this phone for my mom. I had to test it myself for few days to make sure it was OK. I was a little skeptical at first as the price looked unrealistic. 100 bucks, and on top of that a ~$45 discount for the one with adds. I got it for about $60! Folks, it is a great phone. It should be at the $200-300 range. It kind of looks like an iPhone rip-off. thin and slick. beautiful phone, and this comes from a guy who owns a galaxy note edge. The only downside is that the camera is not top-notch. OK, it is expected as the camera makes a phone way more expensive. it can't be compared with my galaxy note edge (> $700 phone) with a 16 mgpxl camera, that put's iphones to shame. Anyway, I did not take any stars off on my ratings as it is not fair. you cant expect a great camera with $60-$100 phone? I need it the phone for my mom which doesn't really use camera, but needs everything else, so it is perfect for her.As for the phone. I got the 2g Ram with the adds. highly recommended to get 2g instead of the 1g. It is just ~$10 more and it really makes a diference. Boy this phone is fast. It works great (And I have note edge, one of the fastest phones out there to compare). As for the ads - what ads? it's more like one line of notification between the other notifications (FB/Email .e.t.c) and it disappears when I slide way them all. I even thought they will bother me when the phone is off. But nothing. you can't tell this is a phone with adds. BTW, the adds are great as they advertise good stuff that are relevant to your likings.this is an unlocked GSM international phone (dual sim) and I inserted two different sim-cards. My mom has her t-mobile card (USA) and her Greek (cosmote) sim-card, on roaming of course. they work beautiful. very easily to synchronize them and set priorities which one is the main and which one is secondary, on all futures. Call, internet and sms for outgoing as well as for incoming. It has its on place on settings as SIM CARDS.  before she had to carry two phones as she gets free text messages from Greece from her friend who can't use internet but have free text sms. so as you can see you can take this phone abroad anywhere the GSM is a standard. I can't speak for cdma technology (Verizon/sprint) as I haven't tested them so you better check before buying. I wouldn't be surprised if they work, technically they should work.to summarize: great phone for the price, camera it's OK, great screen, large, good lighting and colors. Get the ADD version with 2G Ram. So far not a single issue, Oh I forgot - you get the phone with the latest Android operating system (marshmallow 6).",

It only took me about ten minutes to switch in my T-mobile SIM card, power it up, and log into Google. In twenty or so minutes, all of my apps were transferred over and I was good to go. Connecting to our wireless was painless, and I had no trouble logging into free wireless at some of the places I visited this afternoon. The photo quality is good enough for someone like me who's not a power user or selfie queen. It was fully charged within an hour and so far it's holding its battery charge well despite lots of texting and e-mailing. For the price, it looks like it's going to be a great little phone to keep me connected and organized. It feels as solid as my Nexus 5, not cheap or flimsy. For $60, I feel like I got a great phone. I'll be back in a month after our European vacation for a more detailed review, but for now I'm very happy with this purchase. :)ETA 7/20/17 -- I've had this phone for a year, and it still works great. I filled up the internal memory quickly with apps, but added a 32 GB SIM card and transferred most of my downloaded apps over. My only beef with the phone is that it doesn't take as nice photos as my husband's iPhone, but hey, he spent $600 on his phone whereas I spent a tenth of that on mine.",

The built quality was surprisingly better than some of the other phones I have seen in the past.The best thing, glass and body of the phone do not attract dust or fingerprints what so ever, stay clean phone :)One thing I noticed, and it can be good or bad based on your preference is the back panel, it has around 20 small notches that fit into the body of the phone, it feel thin and flexible but fits clean into the body. I am sure you have to delicate while removing it to add sim or memory card.I am not going to get into the details of OS, since its's the same OS with some Amazon apps, nothing unique there. Amazon apps and the stock OS took up around 5.5 gigs, is that even normal ?Camera and screen are not great but, they do what they are supposed to, if not exceed your expectations.

I couldn't justify a new top-of-the-line phone when I was perfectly happy with the N5, and new phones are rumored to be coming for the holidays.  While the processor is a bit slower, resolution is a bit lower, and included storage is smaller, the SD slot for expanding the space and the larger battery make up for some of those weaknesses.  I am a decently sophisticated user, and I've noticed no difference in day-to-day tasks, and a few of my games run better on Blu R1 HD.The Amazon integration is worth the discount and value.  The ads aren't too obtrusive, and can be controlled without too much effortIn summary, I bought this as a short-term stop-gap between my Nexus 5 dying and buying the new generation coming for Christmas.

The Blu R1 may not be blazing fast when you are running a half dozen high level games while streaming video, it does a great job at every day usage with typical game play for the kids when they grab your phone in the car or seamless video streaming via my Prime account. If you keep it vanilla with the close to stock Android OS, I don't expect any noticeable lag times on most games or streaming, whether it's audio or video. I'm using the 2g/16g version. Regardless of reported benchmarks, real world usage is quite smooth.Build construction is impressive for the price with a mostly metal frame and a very crisp screen. Accepting 2 sims may not be useful to most people but it's critical for those who use both a personal sim and a work sim. There's no more need to carry two phones around for work and personal usage. Although expandable memory is capped at 64g, it should be plenty for most users. I've read plenty of complaints about the camera but in my limit experience, photos are quite good, and at this price point they are down right stellar. The speaker sound is dismal. You won't be playing tunes with the external speaker but headphone sound is solid. I thought the ads at the lock screen would be an issue but I don't even notice them any more. It's a non issue considering the amount of garbage we all get in our email and whenever we open a browser page.

    "text": "So far, this phone has exceeded my expectations. I don't downloaded much of anything, but with the few apps I do have the phone doesn't lag. I previously had the Nexus, and I do appreciate this phone's battery life. You'd definitely get a bang for your buck if you decide to purchase.(August 8, 2016 1:28 pm EST) I'm back with an update! Still 5 stars but I've decided to add a little more for those like me who appreciate reviews. For $60.00 I expected to get a working phone. Something simple that I could place and accept phone calls on. Just a plain old wireless device. I got more than I bargained for and I'm not complaining about it! I had a small hiccup with getting the internet to work when I first configured the phone, but eventually that got rolling. This phone does everything that my Nexus did. PLUS MORE. I happen to love all that Amazon offers so the added Amazon apps make this easy for me! I can read all of my books on here when my Fire dies without any trouble! I haven't had any issues at all with the advertising. To be honest, I barely notice it. The phone is slim, sleek and very classy looking. I'm still looking for a case, so all this time I've had the phone without one. No screen protector either, yet it has held up!  All the juggling around in my purse...not a single scratch on the front or the back. I hope I didn't jinx myself there...I've gotten more than my bang for my buck with this purchase. I went out on a limb and i'm glad I did!",

    "text": "Here's what everyone wants to hear. The Ads. I have only bought the ones with them. I have two of these, I would know. It's NOT A BIG DEAL! There will only be fullscreen ads on the lockscreen if there's no updates on your phone aka messages, IG updates, emails, missed calls, etc. Even if there is? It's really not a big deal! I love Amazon and I don't mind their ads, in fact, I have already seen things that I ended up needing and purchasing them, even some free apps that I will be using for a long time. Anyone with a Kindle, you understand. It's not a big deal. If you aren't a Prime member and are really anal about seeing things you don't want on the homescreen, get a different phone. Okay, or just get the ad free one.Now.............GREAT phone! Unlocked goodness. I use it with T-mobile, but will be, shortly, switching to Cricket Mobile for the savings.I came from an LG G3 that was having sim-card tray issues, so it was a big change (downwards) for me, but this phone is still awesome. It's relatively light, has great colours, uses the latest Android OS, and is relatively quick compared to my LG G3. I got this phone on Prime Day 2016, so I've had it quite some time now. It has two SIM card trays, which is great for someone who travels overseas often or is brave enough to use one phone as both a personal and trap phone......o.O nevermind. It can keep up with the amount of apps and games I was using on my G3, so that's a plus.There are, obviously, downsides to this phone. One is the sound quality. It's NOT BAD, but it's so low compared to my G3, which I have problems with. That's even with the headset on. Secondly, people complain about...certain...phones having thin screens that shatter easy? This is one of them. I was recording myself doing a trick (skateboarding) and the phone fell on it's back. The camera lens was fine! Til I turned it over. Big crack. Then just recently, the phone fell indoors and broke a big chunk of the glass. There was an issue last week where the phone was freezing up, but would be fine upon restarting. That was a slight inconvenience but..yeah. There's no \"Music\" or \"Notepad\" app installed, so for music, for now, you must use Google Music app and download a notepad app. I bought another one, though, that's how much I like this phone.---------------------------------I just want to say one more thing. I was feeling ill the other week and got a bath ready. The phone fell into my FULL bathtub and stayed in there for a while until I realized it (must have been at least 3 seconds)! I immediately pulled it out and took the back off. To my surprise, NOTHING under the back (backing cover/\"battery\" cover) was wet. The SD card slot wasn't wet, the SIM card slot wasn't wet, absolutely NOTHING was wet!! No drips, no wet spots, noootthhiiinnngg. I've had this phone for almost 5 months, and use it daily. It's been great. Runs out of memory quick after a while, but it's not a big deal for me, I have other phones for major app storage. I still recommend this baby.",

    "text": "For the price this is OK.  I used this for about a month. I keep it as a backup.  Performance is good. WiFi is good. Reception is good. GPS worked well for me.  The screen is not very tough ... after just a few days in my pocket it had some scratches and some light cracks in a corner part of the screen that doesn't displays anything. This was without a case. I assume these came from my keys or other items in my pocket. It was not dropped.  However, it never got worse and I never bought a case.  My biggest problem is that I always seemed frustrated with the phone. The screen is too touchy. Just holding the phone it seems I would always make an accidental call or sometimes hangup on a call with my face.  The interface was clunky for some common features. Hard to get voicemail without using the popup notifications. Hard to get notifications right. Even the way you answer the phone took some experimentation. The first time I got a call with the phone locked ... I had no clue how to answer it.It is a workable phone but I was very happy to go back to my iPhone 6+. But the iPhone6+ was once a flagship phone with a flagship price (but not without its own issues.)",

    "text": "At $50, this phone is prettier than many pricier phone, such the Nexus 5x. With 5\" screen, this R1 body is slighter smaller than the 5x with a 5.2\" screen. The respectable and thinner look is due to the curved glass edge and the curved, graphite colored metal frame. The 5x and many other phones are boxy in comparison. Because of the more exposed glass edge, I recommend a case that protects against a high corner drop; don't ask me how I know.I would have written a review much earlier if the R1 wasn't off the market for months, driven me to buy another prime exclusive costing twice as much and not as pretty. As long as you don't want this phone to compete with mid-range phones or high-end phones, everything is better than expected. It has 4G LTE and supports TMO band 12 that penetrates walls better. Quality glass with pretty rounded edge. 5MP selfie. 2GB RAM minimum for Pokemon Go. 720P HD display. My kids have been using it for months and they aren't bothered by the ads.The phone works well for Project Fi, which is not the cheapest. But once you have a Fi account, you become a nano 4G carrier with up to 9 subscribers, at $10 per GB or 1c per MB actually used without fixed charge.To activate a Project Fi account you need the normal SIM and a supported phone. Once you have an account, the normal Fi SIM works on this R1 without changing any settings. Though, it makes more sense if you use the Fi SIM on an iPhone 6S. Yes, it works with minor APN settings. In any case, you lost some advanced Fi features and some carrier-specific features. For a non-Fi phone, you are basically using the TMO network without carrier switching. And VoLTE on TMO may or may not work.The best thing about Fi is the data only SIM, at only 1c per MB. You pay only for the data used and nothing else. You don't lose any features because these SIM are using the plain TMO 4G LTE network including band 12 for better indoors penetration. The data only SIM works on many phones including this R1.You can still have normal voice and txt even though the SIM is data only. In short, you just need to replace the stock dialer and messenger with google hangout. You need to join google voice asking for a new free phone number, or porting your old mobile number for $20. It appears as a normal phone with a normal phone number; you just use a different app for the dailer and the messenger. You have your own voice over Wifi or over LTE.Voice over data only SIM is in the order of 1c per minute and negligible for txt. This is highly competitive compared to the TMO to go plan at 10c per minute or 10c per text. In addiction, data is charged per MB or for each cent without rounding up to a minute. This is a great family plan at $20 minimum per month and 1c per MB used. The account holder can monitor the data usage on each SIM easily.Wifi hotspot doesn't work for the Fi data sim on this phone, but on many other phones. Project Fi doesn't support hotspot on the data only SIM because they cannot guarantee tethering to work on all possible devices. The problem on the R1 is that you will get a gateway IP of 192.168.xxxx.1, which is a local non-functional address. The R1 is a popular target for rooting with plenty of instructions. One might be able to reroute after that, and to make it less prime exclusive.The price is so good that I would use this phone to replace a landline via hangout, and mount this phone more permanently with power supply on the car dashboard for navigation and for a dedicated car phone, saving a lot of inconvenience and battery on my phone. Hangout and most VoIP apps do not support E911. Though any mobile phone can do emergency calls, the call center do not get your phone number automatically to call you back. You can add VoIP plans for a few dollars that support E911, or add a voice & text only 2nd SIM like the TMO to go plan for $3 minumum that supports E911.",

    "text": "My LG G3 crashed on me, I was hoping it would last until the release of the Samsung Galaxy S8. I bought this phone as a temporary phone to get me through the next few months or so. Don't do what I did, get the 16 GB not the 8 GB. The 8 GB fills up quickly with only several apps. If however, you do get the 8, there is a way around this... Insert a micro SD card into the back of the phone and move some of your apps over from the hardrive to the SD (choose permanent setting, not temporary). One caveat, if you move the apps to the SD card, you will not be able to use them as widgets. Otherwise, this has worked well for me.The bad: Overall screen quality is inferior to my old phone. The speaker is pretty awful.The good: Nice user interface, cheap. Incredible for the money! You will not find a better $50-60 phone.The ugly: it's slow and laggy at times. Would not use as a permanent phone** For T Mobile it has worked great. Here's what to do.#1 buy the phone#2 open up back cover(it's a pain to do)#3 remove sim card from old phone and place in the BLU R1 HD#4 turn on phone and proceed with setup stepsAnyone idiot can do this without taking it into the store.",

    "text": "I am not a gamer. I actually use a phone to be productive and communicate with others. If you are a gamer and you are trying to make a buying decision about this phone with help from this review, you might as well skip to the next posting.My previous phone has similar specs to this R1 HD (16g/2gRAM). This little Amazon subsidized Blu phone out performs it in every category, even though the 'experts' who bench test these devices feel like it shouldn't.There are lots of video reviews that ramble on about numbers, build, ads, etc. so I will skip that. What I will say is that I now have a speedy, attractive device that has my Amazon content and my Google Play content SIDE BY SIDE without rooting or sideloading. I love it.Price point wouldn't effect my opinion of this phone. My wife's phone is a flagship. My previous phone is a mid priced model. This Blu R1 HD Prime Edition phone performs better than the mid range phone and does a number of tasks as well as the flagship phone. It just happens to be hundreds of dollars less expensive than either of them.Apps I use everyday include the Messaging app, phone, SwiftKey keyboard,  a weather radar app, Memento database, MLB At Bat, Chrome and YouTube. They are all freaky fast and perform without a hiccup.I use Macs. My wife and I both have e-ink Kindle Readers and Kindle Fire 10 HDs. I also have a Chromebook and a Nexus tablet. I have a Fire Stick and a much loved Echo. I know my way around devices as an end user - and I would recommend this R1 HD (16g/2gRAM) Blu phone to anyone. It would satisfy a smartphone rookie or seasoned digital veteran.In closing, I look forward to being productive with Google and watching Amazon Studios 'The Grand Tour' on the same device. I am very happy with the Blu R1 HD.",

    "text": "Update 1/29/2017:Still loving this phone.  No complaints/issues after 5 months, and earlier tonight I dropped it off my 2nd floor balcony and it is still going strong and the screen is still intact.  The Poetic case I purchased for it may have helped in the fall.  I was using it as a flashlight at the time, and was hopeful it had survived the fall since the light was still on when I ran downstairs to fetch it.  If it hadn't survived I would have purchased another one as a replacement without hesitation.----I'd really give this a 4.5 star review, and not a 5, but I don't think it deserves a 4.I've had this phone for 5 days now and love it (16gb/2gb version).  I am using it with Tracfone prepaid, and just stuck the sim card from my old phone in and it worked right off the bat ( had purchased the $1 bring your own sim kit from Tracfone and did wind up activating it on this phone so my old phone can act as a backup just in case).  I purchased the ad enabled version, and the ads are not intrusive.  There is a widget ad, that I wound up putting on the 3rd home screen, then realized it would just let me remove it, and it hasn't re-appeared.  I installed weather bug, which always has a notification on the lock screen, so I just see 1 ad notification on the lock screen, and you can swipe it away (otherwise would get the full screen ad if there were no notifications, but either way I didn't think the ads were intrusive).I've seen some reviews saying the camera was so-so.  Seemed fine to me as I had to use it over the weekend to document some issues at work, but I am not a big shutter bug either.Phone call quality could be a bit better (this is where I would subtract 1/2 of a star from my review).Battery life seems OK, could be a bit better, but I've been abusing the heck out of since it is a new phone.Screen looks awesome compared to my old Alcatel $30 phone, or even my old work iPhone.  And apps don't crash at random, and it has enough storage space that if I want to try something new, I don't have to choose something to uninstall.  Can expand storage with an sdcard.Overall, awesome $60 smart phone, and works well with my Tracfone pre-paid service, and it plays Pokemon Go :)My only real complaint is about getting a case for it.  My case for it was supposed to arrive yesterday and that didn't happen, but Amazon had e-mailed me saying it was delayed, and now it is supposed to be here in 8 more days.  Other cases for this phone have estimated arrival dates 30-60 days out.  And for being an Amazon Prime sponsored phone, it took 5 days to arrive.",

I found this phone in Amazon and start to do more research about this phone.

Extremely affordable....($69 16G/2G). in addition, no need to buy insurance for lost or damage...($15 a month). 2. very small foot print on stock software. Only few Google Apps and Amazon Apps. a lot of rooms left for your own apps. 3. Response is quick, no lag. LG and Samsung throw in a lot of their own Apps that slow down the OS...4. Screen is very bright and clear. Works fine outdoor...Con: 1. Slow Charger...(in a way that you don't have to worry about burning it up)...This phone just open up my eyes that the phone technology had reached a peak...The high end phone and low end phone are very close in performance...there is no need to look around this is phone for you...No need to chase the newest and latest because BLU already giving you the best phone with the low end price.",

Got it to replace my Alcatel One Touch Pixi Glory Straight Talk phone which wasn't a bad phone, it just didn't have the memory or ram size that I wanted and it ran a slightly older version of android than what is on most phones now. The Blu R1 HD is slightly shorter and thinner than that phone but it is way better! The thing that impressed me the most right out of the package was the feel of the glass and the back cover of the phone. The glass feels smooth and of a high grade and the back cover makes the phone seem slightly high end for a \"budget phone\". It's also got a good feel in the hand and has a good weight to it. Inserting the sim, micro SD card and setting up the phone was extremely easy. The Amazon ads on the lock screen don't bother me at all as I have had a Kindle since they first came out. I've only had the phone for a day but so far, I'm very happy with this purchase and even happier that I was able to get it new and for $60 instead of used and twice the price scalpers are posting them for on other websites.",

    "text": "I've written many phone reviews, both good and bad, but this phone from BLU has really surprised me in a good way! I bought a Blu Advance 4.0 last year and it was abysmal. The R1 HD simply blows that phone off the map! Granted, this isn't a flagship device and shouldn't be compared as such. Having said that, I purchased an Alcatel Idol One Touch 3 recently and the Blu keeps up with it stride for stride. The speaker on the Blu is almost laughable as far as sound quality goes, but that's what standard and bluetooth headsets are for. The rear camera is fairly decent for capturing the moment and the front facing one is perfect for Hangouts. I'll need a little more time for battery tests, but it seems to last all day with moderate use and the brightness set to 50%. I haven't jumped on board the Pokemon Go train so I wouldn't be the best one to ask about the phone's prowess in that regard, but I have played some casual games(Monkey boxing, Air Attack, Bowling etc.) and a few graphically demanding ones (Asphalt 8, Riptide GP etc.). They all played just fine. I used an AT&T; sim card with a Samsung micro SD card with no problems getting them to work. There may be some quality control issues with some of the units released, but I've been fortunate so far with the two units I bought. I would definitely skip the 8 GB model unless you really hate yourself and like self torture. 2 GB or more  is essential if you want to have a fluid experience with Android phones. Even at full price, the BLU R1 HD is an exceptional value. Build quality, software and overall general use has been very good thus far. Anyone stressing over lock screen ads that you flick away in less than a second as you would any other lock screen, has some bigger issues going on.",

    "text": "Wow, I'm really impressed with this little phone! I received it ahead of the estimated ETA, and though the packaging is not as fancy as some of my past more expensive phones, the product itself is quite nice. I'm hoping there will be a screen protector and some choice of cases to protect it down the road, cause I can see it being a device I will enjoy using.I already own a Blu Life Pure XL that is great, so I was never a skeptic when it comes to Blu products. The XL has stunning camera performance, great 4G connectivity with AT&T;, and 3GB ram, so it's plenty powerful for me.This little phone is easier to carry in some situations, which makes it a nice alternative, and though I've only snapped a few photos with it, I'm not worried about it falling too short of my expectations. One of my last digital cameras had only 8MP and seemed to take pretty sharp pictures, so I know it's not just the numbers that matter.As far as the operation of the phone, I found it very easy to set up and it restored the apps and wallpaper I have been using on my Huawei Mate 7 and updated itself in about 10 minutes. A few more tweaks with the settings like setting Google Now launcher as the default, and I was up and running. Call quality, network and wifi signal strength are all great, and the screen is very nice as well. Snappy operation and no lags so far. The build quality is also surprisingly fine for a budget device, and the Amazon ads and apps are not intrusive \"at all\", only appearing on the lock screen and swiped away when you unlock the phone. You also have quite easy control over the notifications that appear and it's easy to minimize the apps that are given permission to notify by default. Other than having a different picture on the lock screen each time you click it on, there is really no difference between this phone and any other Android phone I've had. The sound quality is also very good for the occasional speaker/video viewing.All in all I find this to be an amazingly high quality device and think it could sell for the same money as an Alcatel Idol 3 or similar phone. I'm very pleased I took the chance and ordered this product. Amazon has a real winner with this deal.",

    "text": "Having bought several BLU phones now, the R1 HD is a decent buy.  It is well built, possibly one of the best built BLU phones I've handled so far, with maybe the exception of a Vivo 5, and so far works well.That said, you can see the Amazon influence.  One of the things I've liked about BLU from the beginning is the sense of value they try to impress on their customers.  The inclusion of a slip case, screen protector, ear phones, charger and a solid cable have made them stand out in the field of cheap/compromise Android phones.  While you're maybe compromising on a lot of software development and keeping up to date on Android versions, or you're using a lower end SoC, you didn't compromise on what came in the box.  Amazon clearly doesn't have that mentality. You get the phone, in much less durable packaging than BLU has traditionally used, a 1.0A charger and a pretty weak feeling cable.  I have tons of USB cables around and I'll probably switch it out right away.  This wasn't the Amazon 'sponsored' edition of the phone, either, so I'm hoping this isn't a foreshadowing of where BLU is going as they work with Amazon more.  I've bought lower cost phones from BLU that gave you a higher quality cable, had the headphones (which actually aren't too bad), the screen protector and the slip case.  It's a perception thing, really, and this doesn't feel like a quality buy compared to the previous BLU experience.The phone itself is zippy enough for my kids, and coming with Marshmallow was a nice plus.  My higher end phone hasn't yet updated, so kudos for that.  This was an upgrade for one of my daughters from a BLU Neo 4.5, and it's a faster phone for sure, with a more well built feel.  My daughter has already remarked how much faster her games are playing (oh for the days when games were played on game consoles and phones were used to make phone calls :-)).I'd like to see BLU move to newer WiFi chips that support 5GHz, but other than that there are no complaints on the hardware.  The screen is vibrant and bright, and battery life seems to be good so far (but we've had it less than a day).The other thing BLU desperately needs to do is fix their website or build out a proper Amazon web store so you can get adequate information on their multitude of series and models.  It is getting increasingly difficult to research their product portfolio because they don't provide any form of filtering on the site or a real understanding of what drives a different series.  Since features (like LTE or Marshmallow usage) cross series, you can't just go buy based on series, and figuring out the feature sets based on model name is equally frustrating.  They definitely need to put some work into that.",

    "text": "Nothing comes close to competing with this phone in terms of value. Solid screen, snappy, better than expected performance, etc. Unfortunately, there are a few issues that serve as reminders of this being a very budget phone.First and foremost, the terrible audio. Constant hissing and buzzing when any audio cable is connected (I tested several). Total bummer considering I was hoping to use this to listen to music in the car with. Reading other reviews and comments, it would appear that this is a hardware issue.A few other features that you miss out on include: Fast charge, removable battery, support for larger expandable storage (anything over 64gb is viewed as \"corrupted\"), auto-adjusting brightness, and a competent back speaker (don't bother increasing the volume as it pops and sounds worse than listening to an old-time radio through a tin can).Overall though, for $60 this is the best \"burner\" or temp phone you can get your hands on. Works great with T-Mobile's network (including LTE services). I'm quite satisfied with my purchase, but I can't in good conscious award it 5 stars due to the inexcusable audio issues.",

    "text": "I ordered and have been using the 16GB/2GB RAM model.First, I am using this phone on T-Mobile.  It works great in the city that I am in.  However, the phone cannot take advantage of T-Mobile's \"Extended Range LTE\" as it is lacking the correct frequencies to do so.  Also, it cannot use T-Mobile's VoLTE calling, so the call quality may be lower than other phones you are used to using.  Also, there is no WiFi calling support.  There's a few warnings for you.Here's my impressions of the phone otherwise.  The design of the phone is pretty gorgeous.  It looks like a premium phone. Immediately after taking it out of the box I was struck at the smooth lines and premium look. The SIM card and microSD card were a breeze to install.  In almost no time I was up and running. The screen is actually rather pretty.  It shows color detail well.The camera takes decent pictures.  You can tell it's a lower end setup, but that shouldn't be a surprise to you.  After uploading the pictures to Facebook, it is less apparent compared to others.The Amazon ads aren't obtrusive at all.  Who really looks at the lock screen anyway?  I don't.  I just swipe and quickly go to using the phone, much like a do on my Kindle.  Am I firmly attached to the Amazon ecosystem?  Yes.  Would the ads bother me otherwise?  Probably not, honestly.All and all, the phone is pretty great, especially for the price.  Just be cautious if your T-Mobile coverage is \"extended range LTE\" as this phone will likely not work well for you.",

    "text": "Purchased this phone as a both a back-up and because GPS functionality on my current phone (HTC One M7 for comparison). Did not expect to use it outside of a situation where someone in my family's phone had to be send in for repair, or when I needed GPS. I am so far - after three days of use - impressed enough with it that I am currently using it as my primary phone. Not going to rehash the specs, but I would definitely recommend springing for the 2GB RAM version. In 2016, even running Android Marshmallow which is very resource efficient, 1GB isn't going to cut it for the average smartphone user. Running multiple apps at the same time does produce some slowdown but it is definitely usable and doesn't feel like a $60 phone at all.The ads are pretty unobtrusive. Obviously not ideal and I am not a fan of all the Amazon bloatware either, but you know what you're getting into when you order the phone. The price you pay having to deal with the ads is worth it, IMO. Otherwise it runs pretty close to stock Android, which is nice.Build quality is solid. Plastic back pops off for pretty easy access. SIM card holders are pretty finicky and since I think a lot of people are going to be getting a lot of use out of them using this phone as a burner that they switch on and off network often I hope they can handle the repeated use. No replaceable battery, but it is a budget phone.Camera is solid, nothing to write home about, no Gyroscope, but again, this is a budget phone.Speaker quality is the one big knock I have against it. Even considering the price point it is pretty bad for a phone released in 2016.Glad I bought this, will definitely hold me over for a few months until I take the dive into one of the new Nexus products releasing later this year. For anyone looking for a replacement phone, backup, or something to hold them over for a few months to get something better, this is a great value.",

This thing is absolutely comparable to every other smartphones like iphone 6, Samsung galaxy edge 6,etc. Bought it for my mom. The Screen/display is super gorgeous and when i compare it to my HTC M8, i would choose this phone over HTC M8 just for the screen. And with that price point, this phone is like a revolution. Camera is definitely comparable to iPhone 6. I compared the photos by this to iPhone 6 and trust me i preferred this phone's camera than of iPhone 6. I mean it is definitely not inferior than that of iPhone 6.  Battery life rocks but is not that good as the capacity is not that comparable. But still it lasts as much as a moto G3. The screen when touched feels so smooth and soft to touch, it is a joy using this phone. Also the glass can be called somewhat curved. Also has a microSD card slot which is handy to install apps on SD. The menu has a direct option of installing apps and everything directly onto SD card. Absolutely amazing for 50$.",

It is really handy for me as I am a Prime member and use most of the Prime services such as movies, tv shows, video games, apps, and music. I love the face it has the Google Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS and 16 GB storage w/ 2 GB RAM. Surprisingly the ads are not all intrusive and are very minimal and you always have the option to pay to remove, but I honestly don\u2019t mind them. It has dual SIM and MicroSD support for up to 64 GB of expandable storage. It has a 5 inch HD display with curved Gorilla Glass 3 protection, and an 8 MP main camera and 5 MP selfie camera that includes a front-facing LED flash. Also it is 4G LTE and GSM unlocked so you can choose your own carrier or travel. The phone is 6.7 x 3.6 x 1.7 inches  and it weighs 9.6 ounces.This phone is most definitely the best bang for your buck and then some. We have several phones in our home including iphones, galaxy phones, and a few others and this one is the new \u201cit\u201d phone. I am always buying cases for all of our phones to keep them protected at all times and I did purchase the Blu case for this phone but I do hope that many more options become available for it. Oh, and YES you can play Pokemon Go with this phone\u2026..which is why I had to purchase another one just to get mine back from the kids.UPDATE: The second one I purchased (without ads) is the same but without ads.

It is SUPER fast with 2gb of RAM and has plenty of internal storage (16gb with expandable sd card up to 64gb, I only have a 32gb one). Upon opening, the device had 5gb used for the OS, but still left me with plenty to download all of my apps. The weird thing is that this runs android 6.0 so when you download the apps, apps that run 6.0 do not require you to accept permissions for the app until the app itself is opened.Keep in mind that, depending on your carrier, you cannot just throw the SIM card in and have it work. I took my SIM card out of my Samsung but I still had to call MetroPCS to have them \"activate\" the device.The camera is spectacular compared to the Samsung. 8mp camera and 5mp front facing camera is so much better than 5mp and 2 front facing. Also, the front facing camera also has a flash! YAY!The only negative that I can find about this phone is that the speaker is really sucky for playing music, but for the price, I am willing to accept that, especially since I have a decent Bluetooth speaker for that exact purpose.I have only had this phone for a few days, if anything changes with my experience, I will update my review!",

I thought they were lying about the specs for that price. I went over to GSMArena, lo and behold it is the same specs.  I decided to purchase the phone with the recommended protective case (highly recommend, love the case).  Delivery time excellent.  Unpacking the phone, no hassle.  Installing sim cards and memory, easy.  Putting on the phone for the first time, going through the setup, normal like every Android phone.

And if I have another notice on the lock screen (such as email notification) then the ad isn't even full screen, just the same size as the other notifications.In fact since the ads are based on my shopping history (just like the Amazon website and apps) the ads I see are actually things I might be interested in.In short if you want a great phone that can easily be a daily driver for an amazing price grab the Blu R1 HD, it's a great phone.I would recommend getting the higher end model as the newer versions of Android really run best with the 2GB of RAM and the 16GB storage is probably all most users will need.",

This of course can be caused by the screen protector I have on it and I have freezing fingertips. Easily overcome by upping the sensitivity. I have only two complains.One:-This phone only runs/ connects w/ AT&T; towers. ( I have TracFone, so I believe this could be different for other carriers.) But it would seem it doesn't connect to any Verizon towers. This would be fine but when u live in a rural place like I do this can become a problem.Two:- Tethering issues. This has been a bit of an issue but not a bad one. It's more annoying when I really want to transfer something quickly and easily without using Bluetooth.Overall a great phone for the price. It can compete with my friend's Galaxy S6 without a moment's hesitation. As long as you put a protective case on it, the thing could last you a while. The battery is pretty impressive, it can last me the entire day (medium use) on a lower lit setting. User friendly. As for gaming I can't really say. It has done pretty well with Minecraft and such as far as I can tell. The speaker isn't that great but I don't use it very much anyway. All in all not bad.",

Just ordered the Moto E4 and will send this back once I have that set up.I broke a my Moto g5+ (a violent breakage, thats not a fragile phone) so decided to try one of these as either it would be good enough to actually use for a while or have as fallback phone in the future.I'm not going to write a thorough review, but these deficiencies I didn't acknowledge prior to using:- No ambient light sensor - the display does not automatically adjust so it's always too bright or too dim.- No fingerprint reader - yes they are finicky but it feels like a major omission to me.These are items the Moto e4 has so I'll likely be trading this in for.On the plus side it feels like a much more that $60 phone. The display is nice enough (colors a bit washed but otherwise fine), and build quality is better than I expected - it actually looks pretty nice. It's somewhat slow but probably good enough (at least now, phones tend to get slower over time). I can't judge the battery life, camera or sound yet, but I'm not very hopeful in those areas. It also charges rather slowly.My Moto G5+ had excellent battery life (2 days), very fast charging, a impressive display, and I loved the clear front firing speaker for watching videos - I vastly preferred that phone over my prior GS6 or my wife's iphone 6s. Moto E4 might be good enough for me as a light phone user so I might try that next or just give up and repurchase the G5+ again. I'm hoping to see the next iphone/pixel first though.  All in all this doesn't seem like a bad phone, but one of the Moto's are probably worth the price even if your on a tight budget.",

I bought it to replace (my still working) Samsung Galaxy N-910A since I was tired of the performance and old software issues (flooded with bloatware) from Samsung and I am thinking that this was a nice temporary replacement (while the cost of the Note 7 lower on next year), besides I have 2 SIM Cards on it and everything is working perfectly, very good product!Update: The only feedback that I have at the moment is regarding the audio quality with headphones and calls. Its very average, so don't expect something great. The sound is like old Nexus 4 and 5 (No EQ, no surround, nothing!).Photo Quality: Average photos, but since the phone is already packed with a 8 MP Sensor even when the result is not great, if you use \"Pic Say Pro\", \"LR3\" or some other Photo Editing App to improve saturation, contrast and sharpness, at the end, you'll get a result such as new Samsung Devices.",

    "text": "What an absolute delight it was when I received this BLU R1 HD smart phone, I mean sure I already knew what the specs of this phone were,  however, I never expected the overall feel. I've owned several budget friendly smartphones over the years including a few other BLU phones but, this R1 HD is by far the better of ALL the BLU phones I've owned. For starters, it's sleek, thin and lightweight but it doesn't feel like it's cheap or cheaply made (if that makes any sense). The screen is super smooth glass, bright, crisp and sharp it truly does appear to be HD screen, the touch screen is super responsive with minimal if any \"dead zones\", videos look extremely good, colors seem accurate and vivid. Although the CPU isn't going to shatter any speed records, it really does an excellent job, pretty quick when loading web pages, not laggy or slow. The 2Gb of RAM plus the 16Gb of memory is also unusual (for a budget phone) but welcomed addition which, for my particular needs is more than adequate, especially after I  added a 32Gb micro SD card. Picture quality is decent with built in quick photo editing software you can tweak your pics on the fly without having to open up a separate app, I personally love the front facing selfie cam which boasts 5MP with flash. Battery life is also surprisingly good, going nearly 12 hours of normal use i.e, FB, Instagram, WhatsApp surfing the web, checking emails etc before needing to be charged. As a prime member I ordered the phone with the ads on your lock screen, I figured the heck with it I'll deal with the ads even if it means having to sit through ads but, surprisingly they do not take anything away from this phone what's so ever you just swipe and go on about your business. The only complain or con is the sound quality, the phones speaker isn't going to blow you away but, then again, show me a smart phone that will, it wasn't enough to turn me off I mean most of us use ear buds anyway right?In conclusion I gotta say I really am impressed and I'm loving this phone, I mean sure it's only been a couple of weeks and if anything comes up I will surely update this review but as for now not much to complain about.By the way, I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS FOR FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT, I PAID THE ACTUAL PRICE FOR THE VERSION I BOUGHT WITH MY HARD EARNED MONEY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REVIEW ARE MINE AND NOT INFLUENCED BY ANYONE ELSE BUT ME.",

    "text": "The reason I bought this BLU R1 HD phone is because my Galaxy S7 was stolen. I love new cell phones so I am used to have a new phone each year \u2013 avid iPhone and Galaxy user. That being said here is my review sort of comparing them to today\u2019s hottest phones:First impression, unboxing, not super impressed but for $70 who cares ( I bought the Amazon adware one \u2013 16GB version). I turned it on and noticed it has a slow start process but many phones are slow starting. Wish companies would incorporate an SSD drive. I noticed the screen is bright which I like however no matter how much I played with the display settings, the color is a little faded. Doesn\u2019t have that \u201ctrue\u201d color that an iPhone 6s or Galaxy s7 has but its just a shade faded. Not horrible and for $70, very happy with it. I loved movies and pictures on it and that fade feeling is still there but the crispness of the movies in 1080p / 720p are still impressive for a $70 machine. Currently watching Chappie on it and I cant even tell the faded screen is there.Camera is not great. Even in direct sunlight outside, its feels like a 5-8 megapixel camera. Still it gets the job done. I tried very hard to focus on the Grumpy figurine and just couldn\u2019t get a crisp picture but you decide.I noticed some functions are a little slow like opening new apps. Also noticed downloading an app or updating takes a bit longer than usual. Can only update/download one thing at a time.Two things I did not like at all was the speaker. Whether irs a movie your playing, talking on speaker phone or listening to music, you NEED headphones or a blue tooth speaker to turn up the volume. Very low volume on the speaker. Call volume without speaker is perfectly fine. The other thing is that the screen scratches very easily. I only had the phone a day and see little fine scratches in the corners from my pocket or on the desk..Otherwise that\u2019s about it. Gaming seems fine but I don\u2019t ever play heavy graphics games, just games like Hayday or Clash of Clans.In Summary, comparing a $70 phone to a $700 phone, this will seem like gold. It\u2019s a decent phone, Im able to watch movies on it and enjoy web browsing and messaging so for $70 I cannot complain which is why I give this 5 stars. If I truly compare this to a new iPhone or Galaxy, I would give it 2 or 3 stars but that\u2019s not fair to rate this phone bad compared to a high end phone. I would have liked to compare this phone with the Vivo 5 and Vivo XL in my hands to see which I liked best. I may want to upgrade to the XL or Vivo 5.****Update***** a week or so later I noticed my phone was restarting a couple times a day at random, even if the phone wasn't being touched. I returned it, got a new one, new one had no problems however I have a huge problem! The wifi on this is likely an old wifi/b card. I have up to date wifi router at home... so although my iphones and tablets could connect to this, I could not with my R1 HD, very disappointed. Will be returning the phone.",

Good size and weight for a 5'' screen phone.- Works with project fi. \"Project Fi\" appears as carrier name when I insert the SIM card. I heard people say it only uses T-mobile. You can still install the Project Fi app to monitor the data. You don't have other functions like wifi calling, automatic switching between carriers.- Thank god it has Google Store :)- Battery life is good. I got 50-60% at the end of the day after moderate use. This never happened to my Nexus 5X. I guess one reason is that I only have a few apps installed.- Taking pictures is very fast. Certainly they don't have the best qualities.- Ads are a bit more annoying than I thought. They are fine on kindles. I see ads once before I turn on my kindle every time I read. But for phones, I look at lock screens many more times than on my kindle. But I'm aware of saving $50 by seeing ads :)",

    "text": "I ordered the BLU R1 HD to replace an LG G3 that's screen had died in July. Since many of the new phones would be coming out in September/October, I wanted to wait for for the Note 7, Iphone 7, or Pixel phone before getting a real long term smartphone. I found the BLU R1 on Prime Day and ordered it with ads because the cost would be the same as some of those other phones for 2 to 3 month rental. Now that all of the big phones have been announced, I think I am going to pass on them. All because of this little phone. The build quality is great, it is fast enough for what I do with it (instagram and some games) and it is not adding to an extra charge on my phone bill. Part of what makes it great is that out of the box it was set to work with both Amazon and Google. There was no need to download Amazon's appstore just to access the few apps of their's that I use, and it wasn't like the Fire devices that you had to jump through hoops just to get the Play store up and running.This thing just works. Maybe in spring I'll change my tune, and want a beefier phone, but right now this does everything that I want it to do. If I had 1 gripe, I wish the camera took better photos, but they work for most of what I do.",

I used it for the basics: non power hungry gaming, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook...as I said, the basics, lol! It did not lag or anything. I will say that the speaker is not that great for music and Netflix, but headphones or a Bluetooth speaker are your best friend for this small gripe. The camera is clear and crisp (used it during a football game to catch my sons marching band performance). And the screen is gorgeous! I could use it day to day, but as I said, we use it for, say it with me, the basics!!! I did bulk it up with a glass screen protector, and a nice protective case (think otterbox denfender here).

    "text": "First I wanna say I'm a little disappointed with Amazon not allowing me to purchase more than one of this phone (I have 2 kids and had to buy one 16GB and the other 8GB models). I understand this is to avoid someone buying a bunch of them and reselling them at steep prices but maybe increase the limit to 2 per customer. With that out the way I have to say this is the best phone at the moment for the price. NO it's NOT a flagship or even a midrange smartphone so don't expect it to be. It is an entry level smartphone that works very well and makes a perfect gift for the kids, a family member or yourself if you're looking for a replacement phone but don't wanna break the bank for it. I bought the ad supported version which was under $60 unlocked with free shipping. Can't really beat that deal. The ads appear on the lock screen and immediately dissappear after you unlock the screen so they don't bother me at all. Now if you're someone who hates ads and can't stand them being on your lockscreen then look elsewhere as there's no way to buy out of them once you purchase it. All in all I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a responsive, entry level, budget friendly phone.",

As I don't make a huge amount of calls or texts and use wireless whenever possible I wanted to remain on the Tracfone plan I've used for years. I bought this phone without a SIM card and bought a SIM card for AT&T;/Unlocked phones from Tracfone directly for use with this phone, (costing me about $6 including delivery and took about three days to come.) Upon inserting the SIM and a 32gb SD card I visited the Tracfone site again and started the process to transfer my number/minutes/data mb/texts over to this new phone from my old one. I'm not sure how long this took, but it was all completed by the time I checked the next morning and I've had no issues using this phone on Tracfone since in my local area or elsewhere.The phone itself is fabulous - 2gb of RAM coupled with the relatively fast quad core CPU ensures there's plenty of resources to run everything I've installed. The screen has a great display, the wireless is strong, and the cameras are both more than adequate. I bought the version with the ads and even these don't get in the way of the user experience. Android 6 is a joy to use and addresses a few issues I've had with earlier versions of Android. The pre-installed apps are all things I use, (being a Prime subscriber), so there's no wasted storage as these apps are things I would want to install anyway. Having 16gb of native storage is wonderful too - there's plenty of space to install all the apps I want without having to resort to using a slower SD card to install apps on -- I can just use the additional SD card now for my music, data and personal files.For what I want a smart phone to do this phone checks every box. For the money it was a total no-brainer for me and I am very glad I bought this phone.",

    "text": "To start with, five stars is the minimum rating for this phone, once you consider all the variables. This isn't about comparing it to flagship phones, because it's not competing with them. What this is about is a budget phone that overachieves in almost every way.I'll update this review at a few intervals to account for long-term use and changes in opinion based on my feelings after living with the phone a while.Day 1Packaging - The phone is packaged pretty much like any other phone, though sparsely. Not much in the box outside of the phone and charger/cable.Setup - Setting up the R1 HD is just like setting up any Android phone. I punched in my Google login and then got to work on installing apps. Connection to Amazon apps, Google apps, email, etc. was quick and painless. Connectivity strong, fast downloads and installations.Basic Performance - I'm still slightly shocked that I only paid $60 for this phone. I've been using a Note 4 for the past year or so, and I'm seeing zero performance difference so far. I will add the caveat to this that I use my phone for plenty of purposes, but I don't do any intensive gaming (word-based puzzle games are my gig), so apps that see lots of use daily for me include ESPN, AP Mobile, Audible, Amazon MP3, Waze, Outlook/Boxer, Textra, Bleacher Report, MLB At Bat, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Basic news, social, and some media apps. That being said, this thing runs them like a champ, and I feel like a chump for spending so much on flagship smartphones if this little guy keeps going strong.Amazon \"Ads\" - So this is the Prime Exclusive with ads on the lockscreen. To those who are complaining about this - Are you freaking kidding me? I don't even notice the little sliver of an ad that pops on my lock screen. It is so unobtrusive as to be almost non-existent. My family has several Fire tablets, and most have ads on their lockscreens, which is to say the entire lockscreen IS an ad. Even that's not a big deal. It's a lockscreen. Keep Calm and Swipe On. Seriously. For Amazon to subsidize half the cost of this phone in exchange for that little blip is fine by me. And just in case anyone from Amazon is reading, I'll be happy to test out a new 70\" 4K screen with ads whenever you decide to go that route...Bottom Line - Like the headline says, why on earth don't you already have one of these? Great for a cheap kids phone, sure, but initial impressions are that it's a great phone period, no qualifiers needed. Buy it.",

    "text": "I handed the Blu R1 HD to a tech savvy friend. \"Try this,\" I said. What do you think it cost? He weighed it in his hand, opened an app and scrolled. \"$400?\"5 stars for sure, based on quality and value. If I were to compare it to a $800+ Galaxy Note 7 without taking into account cost, I'd give it 2 or 3 stars. Since the Note 7 costs about 14x as much, this comparison shows just what a great phone this Blu is.The Blu is really impressive. It's fast enough, faster than my iPhone 5S (not the latest--last generation). The screen is bright and clear, although I'd like higher resolution. It feels solid and well made.At this writing, it had a recent OS security upgrade, comes with the latest version of Android, and is reported to be upgradable to the next version (Nougat). This is really impressive, since upgrades to the next version of Android are uncertain with much more expensive phones. Since I like Android, maybe a bit more than IOS, getting this phone for $60 is a real treat.As for the ads, they don't bother me at all.I'm using it with Cricket, and it seems to work fine.If you're a Prime member looking for a phone, this Blu is worth a try.",

    "text": "Hmmm.... what to say.... Great device for sure,  - I got the 16 GB ROM / 2 GB RAM version - so performance wise its on spot. Nice weight in the hands, and some folks will like the more elongated 5.0\" screen size as it cups in the hands a little bit more (like an iPod Touch 4th Gen would) but at the same time it made the screen look more like 4.5\" than a 5\" in my opinion. I'll compare it to my Microsoft Lumia 640 and upload a picture soon. Use battery intensive apps like Pokemon GO, and while it didn't last the day (I had the PoGo -UWP beta app on my Lumia and it lasted much longer), it did hold out for about 8-10 hours. Gonna try the LTE service this week, but call quality and 3G+/4G is a-ok. The build quality gives an awesome premium feel. But I have to say that I hate the back cover, as it feels like it might as well be a unibody device because the flimsy clips make it feel like your stripping off skin rather than trying to get into the device itself.I am pleased that I can access my micro SIM slots and memory card without having to take out the battery - granted I wouldn't recommend anyone doing that. The screen is great in sun light, but black levels to me aren't as great to me in comparison to my L640 - granted I wear glasses. I do miss the tap to wake feature and glance screen on my L640 whenever I use this android device. Sound quality is good, and picture quality, though i haven't tested it out fully is - ahh, umm, meh... But the front facing flash is definitely a nice feature to have. I'm not a fan of the bulged 8MP camera on the back, as I wished I had the device just have one smooth finish, but it does come in handy when holding the slender body of the device that sometimes feel like it would slide out of my big-ish hands. Again not really a complaint, I just got used to a wider 5.0\" screen size. I pkan to do a more in depth review and post via YouTube, but for now, I hope this helps others who are thinking about getting this device.",

    "text": "At my side, I have to cell phones: one is my iphone 6, which has been by my side, at my fingertips, and been my most constant companion for two years; the other is my Blu R1 HD, and I have to say that I think my Blu phone is better.My reasoning: the Blu Screen is bigger, and it's noticeable.  Not much, just a tad, but definitely there. Android Marshmallow is responsible, flexible, and snappy, and it makes ios 10 feel weighted down, and that was a surprise to me; as I go back and forth, I quickly lose the sense of the home button to unlock my iphone, as I get quickly used to swiping up on the Blu once again; and since I live far more in the Google ecosystem than the Apple cloud, I find the integration more useful to me.There are some issues.  I am used to having an RFID reader, although Apple Pay is the only real option on my iphone.  Sound is better on the iphone, and it's not close.  The camera is definitely better.  The phone is about a half-ounce lighter, and feels more \"solid.\"It is necessary to note the Amazon ads, but they really don't bother me, since they're only on the lock screen, anyway.If we're talking sheer quality, the iphone is slightly but definitely better., but considering the Blu R1 is one-tenth the price, dollar for dollar, it blows the iphone out of the water.  It's good looking, light enough, and responsive.  This is the phone that anyone should be willing to carry around with them.",

After reading the negative reviews on this phone I must admit I was skeptical, however I couldn't be happier.  It does everything I need it to do!  It was easy to set up.  Took it in to my carrier and had all the contacts switched over in a flash and my blue tooth enabled.  The camera is great and takes quality pictures and videos. Searching the net is a breeze.  It even has emojis (which my old phone did not)  All my friends have to have \"that other phone\" but this great little phone can do most all of the same things for lots less money.  So I just saved at least $500.00, probably more and can use that $$ for something else!  Oh and by the way you hardly even notice the ads as they only come up on one screen which you don't even have to see unless you choose to. Lastly, I will ad that I've only had this for a week but if anything changes I will certainly update otherwise consider it a real bargain!",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure if I wanted a phone with amazon ads. Then I dropped my iPhone while I was traveling and needed a fast replacement. I ordered the 16GB version for $59.99 and have been pleased with the quality and ease of use, so far. At first, I installed a lock screen to get rid of the ads, but they came back. After reorganizing the app icons and getting to know the phone's features, it didn't seem like that big a deal. Now the amazon apps are grouped together, and I actually like having access to music, Kindle, and shopping. One swipe gets rid of the ads. I like the big screen, and I've received compliments from friends who were surprised by the phone's quality and looks. I had to laugh when I went to ATT to activate and an employee told me I wouldn't need a passcode because \"nobody would steal this phone.\"  For me, NOT worrying about having a $600 phone stolen is a good thing so I just smiled when he told me to come back when I want help with my new iPhone. There are fewer accessories for the BLU, but I found a fake leather wallet option that works well. To be fair, I use my phone mostly for texting, emailing, and internet access when I'm away from home, and that's what I've based this review on.",

I've been using the phone for about 6 months. Out of the box it has great battery life, runs pretty smoothly, and is hard to beat for the $60 ad supported version. My biggest requirement, and also the thing that will send any phone to early retirement, is the ability to play Pokemon Go. It does that really well, for me. I don't require AR-pictures, I don't run much in the background while playing (no Facebook or Facebook messenger on this phone), and I don't screen record much at all while playing. It handles the game better, the play is smoother, and it doesn't constantly overheat, unlike my previous phone. There could be a giant list of \"wants\" for better \"features\" but it would drive up the price. If I could change one thing, I would decrease radius of the edge on the gorilla glass, as I think it affects the selfie camera image quality. (I consistently get strange light bending artifacts at the top of the frame). I have received security updates (honestly, I wasn't expecting that at all for a budget phone).

They lack image stabilizer so even if your kid is sleeping and not moving at all the image with be blurry just from your breathing movements unless you use a tripod every time.

I need something that works for hospital and I don't have much money,this seems pretty good stat wise.So I purchased it ,I love it.I love the fact I can download my prime videos and books onto phone and use offline.I love the picture on watching videos the colors are great.The time it holds a charge is great, I am used to phones that only stay up a hour or two. This one lasted me all day at hospital.It takes away time if you watch videos,but you can watch them offline.This phone can use a 128 gb microsd card, not just the 64 advertised.It is fast so far and I love the amazon integration.I use amazon kindle unlimited, amazon prime, so this is perfect phone for me.I haven't seen any unwanted ads.each ad is targeted towards things I want to buy.As usual Amazon has a winner.I own the Amazon tap, this phone, use prime,kindle unlimited and they just mesh really well together. Now that I think of it, I bet my tap would hook to this phone.hmm. I also have several amazon kindle tablets.I always am satisfied with Amazon.",

    "text": "I got the 2Gb Ram BLU R1 HD in July 2017. It is slightly faster than my iPhone 5S. I tested both opening the same apps at the same time on the same wifi. Moving from an Apple based phone into an Android one has been less painful than expected. This is the info I wishI have had before starting the process: To transfer all my contacts I downloaded an app called \"MCBackupPro\". It makes a copy of the contacts and transfers them via email. It costs few bucks and it is worth it. The process was explained in the app and was painless.To transfer my songs I used a free official Android app on my MacBook Pro laptop called \"Android File Transfer\". This app helps your Mac or PC recognize your Blu R1 HD. Transfering songs is as easy as grabing the song you want on iTunes and dropping it under the Music folder on the Android File Transfer window. You can select several files at the same time and drop them all at once.Good luck!",

The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because although I don't find the ads annoying, it keeps getting me to try and sign into my amazon account which I do find annoying. The alarm doesn't work when the phone is switched off, on all other smartphones I have ever used this has not been a problem. When the phone is in airplane mode the alarm doesn't work well, usually goes off 2 mins late and lasts for 2 seconds sometimes doesn't go off at all. The most annoying feature about the phone (and I don't know if it's an android marshmallow problem or a phone specific problem) is when typing, often when I press the space bar it will insert an abbreviation for some unknown reason such as cv asap cc etc this is really annoying because I like predictive text correcting my typing as I go but why insert an abbreviation for no apparent reason, very strange, I've tried googling the problem and so far no luck.",

It doesn't have the advance technologies and other expensive phones such as finger print scanner, a very high resolution display (it's a great screen but it's not 1080 and far from 4k), and a good camera. The camera is pretty bad coming from an iPhone. Also the speaker is very weak. If you get the 16 GB version it's quick to use all you basic apps. The Amazon adds are not bad at all they appear as a notification on your lock screen at the very bottom of your other notifications. If you have no notifications then the lock screen is an ad that takes up the whole display. It's not that intrusive. I used the 8gb version and there is a lag in every app that is very annoying. There is an ad card slot to expand the storage. I can't get over how good this phone looks and feels for the price.",

I destroyed my Vivo 5 which was a nice phone but just a bit too large to fit most places comfortably. The R1 HD is a little thicker, a little shorter in both length and width and I like it better already. Performance is quick but it is new and not bogged down with too many apps. Set-up was a breeze as I had my Vivo backed up with Google and got everything back in tact. For the price I don't think you will find a better phone in terms of RAM 2GB and features. Cameras are ok, nothing great in picture quality but it will do....there is both front and rear flash which is nice to have. The Amazon ads are easy to ignore and do nothing to impede the speed or ease of operation. Get it, with or without the ads it is worth the money.",

The size is very comfortable.  The stock Android install is great, as my father doesn't have to deal with any bloatware installed by vendors or manufacturers.The ads? They're full-screen when there's nothing else to interrupt them.  When a notification comes in the ads reduce to the size of a notification banner.  They're incredibly easy to get accustomed to.This is a great purchase, especially if you know someone who wants to upgrade.",

April 24, 2017On April 18 I returned my R1 HD FOR THE SECOND TIME in 9 1/2 months!  The first return was because the phones wifi had issues with dual \"g\" and \"n\" networks.  BLU replaced the phone but I was without a phone for three weeks.  The second week of April the phone simply died.  It wouldn't do anything.  Please understand both phones lived in the fitted BLU case from day one!  I shipped the second phone back and I'm waiting again.  I asked BLU if they cross ship a phone to reduce my down time and was politely told no. In fact BLU was polite each time I called them BUT in 9 1/2 months I'll be without a phone for 6 weeks!  SMH  Looks like I'm done with BLU products.THE SAGA CONTINUES 5/17:It had been a month since I shipped my phone back to BLU and I received no updates so I called them. I was informed me an email was sent that I never received. She resent the email and I received it in less than 15 seconds.  The email said  \"At this point in time, your device is not available for immediate repair or replacement. For the inconveniences however, we would like to offer a  BLU STUDIO TOUCH as a replacement at no additional cost.\"  Is this the 16gb/2gb version or the 8gb/1gb version? She said 8gb/1gb version.  That's not what I paid for so would I get some sort of compensation?  NO!So here we are I've owned an R1-HD for 10 months and BLU has had it for 2.5 months of them!  Also please understand, I am very easy on phones. When the R1-HD failed I got a sim adapter and began to use my SIX year old T-mobile G2.  After a battery replacement it still works like a champ.",

I had previously used Windows phones and liked them, but as the Windows phone apps are not being developed as much now I saw the need to switch to Android.  I've never been a fan of paying premium prices for the latest and greatest phone.  Although this phone only cost me $60 it has more features than a basic phone.First, the phone itself.  It has a solid feel, not plastic or flimsy.  The screen is 5\" Gorilla glass and curved, which is seen in higher end phones.  The quad core processor and 2GB RAM make it faster than any other phone in its price range.  It has 16 GB internal storage which is fine for me.  A Micro SD card can add another 64 GB of storage for photos, videos and music.  It has a nice camera, 8 megapixel main camera with a 5 megapixel selfie camera, both with LED flash.  Not the very best for taking photos all I've taken have looked good.  I have 2 sim cards in it and it works great for 2 different carriers.  Battery life has been OK, it will last all day with moderate use.  More constant use may require a booster charge sometime during the day.The Amazon Prime ads are not a bother.  They show on the lock screen and an ad shows on the app page.  You can just swipe and get rid of the lock screen ad.  It's just like the Amazon Fire tablet if you've used one before.  Overall I'm very pleased with the phone and can highly recommend it.Updated May 5, 2017: I'm updating my review based on a few months of using the phone. It still performs quite well in some ways, but has some annoyances that have become worse since the latest BLU software update. The updates\u200b many times remove app icons from the screen and I then have to replace them. The latest BLU Android update has killed several apps that I had been using, and when I tried to reinstall them Google Play reports that they are not compatible with my Android (6) version that was just installed with the BLU update. Really??? Apps like Redbox, Walgreens, etc. Now I cannot recommend BLU cell phones.",

You can't beat the pricing and performance is right up there with the rest of them.  Combine that with devices coming unlocked, and you have a winning combination.  In my opinion, look out Apple and Android, there's a new game in town.  My only complaint so far is the device did not come with a headset",

I have not.I really like this phone except for two minor things; 1) It's not very loud. Even at the maximum setting, if it's in your pocket or on a soft surface you may not notice it ringing or alarming.  2) While technically it is a 5\" screen, you lose about a quarter inch of usefulness at the bottom because the home, back, and task-list soft-buttons part of the screen rather than separate from it.  Yes, you can see thru them but you can't put any icons or shortcuts underneath them.  So far, that's it - no problems, no other negatives.The lock-screen ads don't bother me at all and well worth the huge discount.",

    "text": "I have had the BLU R1 HD 16GB for a little over a month at the time of this review.  Overall, I am very pleased with this device.  This is my first Android device.  There is a learning curve coming from Apple but nothing too difficult that most semi-tech savvy people can't adjust to in a few days.  Also, the Internet is full of opinions, fixes, and apps that can help with the transition.My experience...* Screen - Nice and big.  I am guessing iPhone 6 size.  Very clear and responsive.* Phone calls - no issues.* Voicemail - a little old school as there is no native visual voicemail like there is with the iPhone.  The voicemail is number button driven, meaning push 1 to play messages, press 3 to delete, etc.  I enjoyed the visual nature of IOS voicemail.  I know that there are some apps out there that attempt to duplicate that feeling although I have not tried any yet.* Texting - I am using the default Messenger app (not Facebook Messenger).  I have had a couple of issues especially with group texts.  Sometimes I do not see specific people responding in the group text.  There are also times when it shows that I have received a response from a group text but then prompts me to download the message and nothing comes up.  Sort of annoying but not a deal breaker.* WiFi - no issues.  Seems as fast and reliable as my iPhone.* Bluetooth - no issues.  Again seems as fast and reliable as my iPhone.* Camera/Video (both regular and selfie) - The camera has been the biggest noticeable difference of this device when compared to my iPhone 5.  The camera works fine but just doesn't have the quality/sharpness/stability of an iPhone.  It's not terrible but definitely a drop off.* Ads on Lock Screen - This is main reason the phone is $60.  The ads are there but do not interfere in anyway with the functionality of the phone once you open up beyond the lock screen.I ultimately got this phone to test drive as a possible replacement for iPhones for my kids.  For the price, I don't see how you can go wrong with this device unless you are totally against Android devices.  Yes, there are some drawbacks as mentioned above but for those of us who cringe at the thought of replacing damaged iPhone screens or the entire phone...this is a no-brainer.  I use this phone now as my daily phone.I put a case on it and a screen protector film.  Out the door price for everything was only $85!",

They are very tiny and not at all annoying - they pop up in the notification tray and can be swiped away. Sometimes they are a full background Ad, but only on the lock screen. This phone may be $60 but it feels like a much more expensive phone.My only gripe was that the phone when shipped to me gave a \"Process system did not start\" error which caused me to not be able to link my accounts at first.

    "text": "First off, I'm giving this phone 5 starts based strictly off the price to performance ratio. I've owned this phone since late July 2016, and have used it every day since then. Right at six months. It's not a flagship phone, but it does most of what I want it to.Overall I've been very pleased with this thing. Out the box it's a very vanilla Android, which I very much prefer, and performance isn't bad. It does decently well with multitasking, for example, on several occasions I've used it as my main navigation while using it to stream music in my vehicle. It slows down a great deal when doing this, and takes a little patience sometimes, but it will do it mostly without a hitch.Real world performance is great. Every day browsing there's very little noticable slowdown. Opening apps can be a bit slower occasionally then I'd like, but simple games work fine. I doubt you'd be able to play any intense games.Greenify is a fantastic app you should definitely utilize on a phone like this, or any phone actually, preventing apps from running in the back ground prevents apps from slowing the phone down.I use the phone on Cricket, and it works flawlessly. Thus far I've had no issues connecting to LTE or 4g.WIFI can be very fickle. Sometimes it just doesn't detect Wifi networks, and I have no idea why. Other times it works perfectly. No idea if it's a hardware or software issue. It doesn't bother me that much because I have enough data to not worry about it, but I imagine it could be a deal breaker for some.Battery life is great, with moderate to heavy use I generally make it all day without having to charge. All day for me is about 12 hours. Light to no use it'll last 2 days.Over all for the price it's a fantastic phone. And I've had very few issues. Like everyone else has said, camera is subpar. It takes decent pictures, but if you live for photos, look else where. If you want a good budget phone, or even a vacation backup, this is for you. Like I said I've been using it as a daily for 6 months, and unless I find a great deal, it might be in use for another 6 months.",

    "text": "This phone is good quality and has a good camera. It looks slick and feels good in the hand, for $60 it's pretty much unbeatable for a new phone.Pros: Usually fast operation, Good Camera, Full Android, Big Screen, Dual SimCons: Android, Amazon lock screen ads, Lack of physical camera button, No Gyroscope (google cardboard doesn't work), sluggish video recording to onboard memoryMy biggest complaint with this phone is Android, I really hate android... You need an app to do everything and it's a total resource hog. Even the 2gb of ram this has gets bogged down eventually, you need to force close the apps pretty regularly to keep it running smoothly. If you're considering the 1gb version of this phone, stop right now, it will be garbage.The camera on this phone is good enough for most users. It's geared towards speed rather than taking a good picture but if you steady it and take a picture carefully you can get a clear shot.The phone has dual sim slots so you can have two phone numbers active at the same time, this is good for business and international users who may need a worldwide sim card while traveling... The phone also has a MicroSD slot that lets you store photos, music and videos on it or even use it to store apps (requires formatting).Though the back cover is removable (and pretty flimsy plastic) the battery is not.Perhaps my biggest annoyance of this phone (though by my own choosing) are the Amazon lock screen ads. You save $50 off the normal price of the phone so it's worth it but sometimes I find that the phone lags to unlock because of the lock screen ads...Overall, this is a great phone for $60, hard to find anything better but I just can't get over Android. Everything is so clunky and not intuitive in the slightest. You definitely need the 2gb version of this phone, 1gb will not suffice, frankly it probably needs 3gb to be really fluid. If you're an android faithful or never had another smartphone I totally recommend it, Android won't bother you and that's my number one (and far biggest) complaint.EDIT: After using the phone a little longer I can say there are some annoyances. First, there is apparently no gyroscope. I'm genuinely surprised that this is the case because the rest of the phone seems to have semi-premium components. No gyroscope means Google Cardboard/VR does not work as intended. The second big disappointment is that this phone cannot take video if you use the onboard memory. I had it set to record video and save it onboard and it was choppy, pausing every couple seconds. Taking pictures and saving them to the phone is also very laggy. I put my MicroSD (UHS-I) card in the phone and it does record video and take pictures smoothly but storing to onboard memory results in a bad experience.",

And like most (if not all) Android phones, you can add a micro SD card, but it's not the same as internal storage. That will only allow you to add certain things.  The phone is super slow if you don't have a full 4g lte signal.  Most of the time I can not send or receive pictures through texting.  But about a few days out of the month, it will decide to work.  I can still send pics via the Facebook messenger app, so that's nice.  I also wish the speaker was louder, I have a hard time hearing most YouTube videos on it.  the pics it takes aren't bad.  The battery life could be better, but it is ok.  The phone can take a beating though.  I'm hard on phones, so I only buy the cheap ones, and I have had this for almost a year.

I use this for Pok\u00e9mon GO only, and it's not up to specs tech wise to handle an app like that, which is sad. 2GB of RAM and the bloatware included uses most of it unless disabling the apps/background processes.For GPS related apps, such as Pok\u00e9mon GO, this phone could be considered a boon to your game play. The GPS, even set at most precise settings, can jump 100ft or more in seconds switching from home screen to app and back, which benefits hatching/buddy distance in Pok\u00e9mon GO. Unfortunately, lures and incense do not work using that app and this device.Overall a great phone and offer from Amazon/BLU for a low level, smart phone with current tech specs. Also, touch screen is more of a press and hold to get feedback screen. It is touch, not 3D press, but it's not very touch sensitive.Worth the price. Apologies for not testing other aspects, including the actual phone service quality, but this was bought for one app only.

    "text": "My original version of this review was a bit all over the place, so here's a neater version that is far more concise.  You're free to read my rambling review below if you want.Basic Synopsis:  this is an amazing phone for the price tag, if you can handle having an ad on your screen occasionally when you turn the screen on.  $60 for this phone is amazing (at the time of writing), considering that amount is generally only enough to buy an otterbox for most other phones.Pros:great for pokemon go.  Battery lasts reasonably long (though I'd still bring a backup battery pack just in case); I'd say maybe 4 hours of nonstop playinghuge screen, as big as most of the phones that aren't the iPhone 6+ or Galaxy Note 5 or newer.  If you're one of those folks that wants a relatively big phone but not one that is almost in the realm of tablets, then this is the phone for youdual sim support if you need that (if you don't know what that is, don't worry about this point)micro sd slot for upgrading your already reasonable storage sizedecent GPS (not perfect, but it *generally* works indoors unlike some of my more expensive phones)4g lte (fast internet if your carrier supports it)Marshmallow 6 (currently the newest thing available; although Nougat is coming out real soon)and almost all the usual bells and whistles (bluetooth, wifi, GPS)it has a flash/flashlight (even my much more expensive Xperia Z Ultra doesn't have this) - it even has a forward facing flashlight so you can take selfies in the dark.  This one surprised me when I went to take a picture of my silhouette and it flashed me.- notifications LED -  like the old blackberries, there's a dim light on the top of your phone that changes color to let you know things about how charged your battery is when it's plugged in (green for fully charged, red for almost empty, yellow for mid-level, blue for almost fully charged; it also begins flashing orange or red when the battery is under 15% to remind you that it's time to plug it in soon... or else).  It also flashes slowly to let you know you have a text or notification waiting for you so that you don't have to turn on your screen just because you're wondering if there's anything new on Facebook or if your Amazon Prime package is delivered yet.Cons:-  there is no gyroscope.  You won't be able to use features that require you to move your phone around or to tilt it (except for the tilt feature that lets your phone know whether you are holding it vertically or sideways!).  This means no camera for pokemon go (which is not a big issue; I keep it off anyway), but also 0 use with Google Cardboard (you won't even be allowed to install it), and being unable to look at 3d videos on youtube the VR way-  no replaceable battery (although the battery lasts pretty long anyway, and with external batteries being super cheap and powerful now, this isn't as big an issue as it used to be)-  ads, I guess (not a huge issue for me)-  No NFC (I forgot to mention this in my rambling review below).  This means you won't be able to use Android Wallet or to exchange data with other phones or to use those \"tap and sync\" features that some bluetooth devices have.  Not a big deal, though - most people don't even those those features anyway, and let's face it, for a $60 phone, we're lucky we're even getting GPS or LTE/4g, considering most $99 tablets don't even have those features.Original Unorganized Review/Ramble:I used it to temporarily supplement my beloved Xperia Z Ultra (a huge 6.4 inch phone).  It seems to do the job, and if you can handle having to see an ad on your lockscreen (keep in mind that the so called 'hacks' that let you remove the lockscreen or to replace it with a custom lockscreen do NOT work, so don't bother wasting a refund if that was your plan), it's a great phone.  What I didn't realize (since I'm so used to my ginormous xperia z ultra) is that this phone is actually REALLY huge compared to most normal phones.  I think it rivals the iphone 6 [regular, not plus] in size. In fact,  I just did a check - the screen is actually a little bigger than that of the iPhone 6, and is only slightly smaller than the original galaxy note.In other words, for only $60, you're getting a HUGE phone.The only downside, aside for the fact that you have to deal with ads for the subsidy, is that it is lacking a gyroscope.  Which is only really an issue if you're using something that requires you to do virtual reality or related stuff:  for example pokemon go's camera mode, 3d videos on youtube or google cardboard.  These things will not work at all if you try to do them on the phone.However, aside for that, this thing works great with pokemon Go.  I do have the occasional GPS issue with it when playing pokemon (for example, your character appearing to be out of range of a pokestop when you're pretty close to it), but I've had issues with GPS on every single phone I've used (multiple android and a few iphones), so it's probably not related to the phone itself.  But I do need to still put it out here if you were planning on buying this solely for replacing your existing phone due to GPS issues with the game.The star deduction was based on the gyroscope functionality missing.  Not being able to use Google Cardboard is a huge bummer, but not huge enough to warrant more than one star.  The rest of the pros of the phone (cost/size/other functionality/battery life) outweigh the one con.  I should mention battery life is pretty respectable.  Not perfect, but you can last the whole day if you're not doing resource intensive stuff like playing Pokemon Go for hours.  Also, for what it's worth, although it does get pretty warm after a longterm pokesession, it has never gotten hot enough to the point where the \"your device must cool down before charging\" or \"your device must cool down before being usable\" message that I've seen on some other phones.Come to think of it, another pro is that it has two SIM slots if you need to use that functionality.  Another con, though is that it is doesn't have a removable battery, so if you were planning on running two batteries for it, you can't do that.  Come to think of it, I kinda went all over the place, so I'm going to rewrite this a bit more neatly.  [update:  neater review was written]",

I'm just your layman user but I feel like it handles better than my previous iPhone 5  I really feel like it is an upgrade. The screen is bigger, it seems to run smoother, my apps work great, the voice quality is great, and texting is a breeze. I really like this phone and the best part about it is it only cost 60 bucks! I am a believer in you get what you pay for but occasionally I come across an exception and this phone is an exception.Perhaps the difference between the Blu and the 500+ dollar phones is longevity. I guess time will tell.  If I can get one or two years out of this phone it is money well spent.",

    "text": "This phone looks awesome. That's the core of what I'm going with this review. First, the shape is amazing. The side reminds me of an Iphone. But, I'm not going to do comparisons.~~The OS is priceless. Giving the phone the newest one to date (Android 6.0) It's amzing because it helps fix up all the bugs and little glitches that make version 5.1 inferior.Next is the specs. The whole argument with the amazon ads are not so annoying. They do help me out with finding some good deals. Plus, if you don't like looking at them then just go and download a wallpaper app. The internal space is awesome. The equation for the internal storage is (apps that don't uninstall but have updates + apps that can be uninstalled that have updates) this usually tallies up to around 6 or 5 GB of space taken up. But, that's fine by me; kinda reason why I got the 16GB. For the price I pay, it's not too shabby. The speaker is on the bottom but is small. I'd recommend some headphones, or be in a very quiet area.~~Next, the whole \"This phone can burn up\" fiasco is really subjective. Let me tell you something, if you know how to close out apps and keep your phone from using too much at once, it'll never catch extreme heat. If you give this phone to a kid, of course it's going to explode. They don't know any better. So parents, let that be a little tidbit of education for you. Also, if this phone can explode due to overworking itself, then any phone can do that, unless the RAM is higher than like 3GB. This phone has about 2 which is not bad. Again, you have know what you're doing when you get this phone.For what you pay, this phone is very well done.",

    "text": "I've had the phone for about a month now and it is performing above expectation thus far. The 720P HD screen is very sharp. Impressive at this price. Main downside to this phone is the battery. I haven't been using it heavily throughout the day but from a full charge it drops considerably within a short time. However the percentage remaining does last much longer. This may be a deal breaker for power users but then again they are not the target demographic for this device. Excellent back up or even primary phone. I mainly bought this phone for the dual SIM capability which works fine as long as the second SIM is on the T-Mobile network, since they still support 2G. The secondary SIM will only work on 2G, that's the way the radio is designed on the phone. Only the primary SIM is active on 4G LTE. Still it's a workable solution for my needs. I can receive calls/texts on the secondary SIM while LTE data is only active on primary.",

All the reviews said that this was a great phone and they were not lying.

I've bought $60 cell phones to hold me over until i get money to buy a better one but I'm probably gunna stick with this one for a while. The ads after an hour or so you don't even realize they're there. The real nice thing is that the phone has a gorilla glass screen. As someone who seems to have bad luck with phones i like it. If i break it I can just buy another one. My cell carrier is Straight Talk so most of the times im buying used ATT phones. This one was litterally Insert simcard turn phone on and have fun. super simple set up. I think i love it so much is cause it works so much better than my S6 edge that i paid $400 dollars for.

Jumpy in preview mode.  Images often fuzzy even in good light.- Video is shaky and often stutters, both the picture and the audio.- If you have polarized sunglasses, you would be able to see it in portrait orientationMy old Galaxy Note 2 cracked recently, and I needed an inexpensive off-contract phone to use for a while until I could find something.  This phone really impressed overall.  The size is great, and it's much easier to hold and use than my Note was.  The screen is also very bright and readable.  I don't have a ton of apps, but they all transferred over nicely and work fine. Plus, for $60, I don't have to bother with a case or screen protector, so it fits much better in a pocket than most flagship phones, too.I've never had any issue with slow response or lag using any apps, though I don't play games or use anything intensive on the phone.  The only exception to that is the camera, which is the one drawback of this phone after using it a couple weeks.  Even with nothing else running, the preview is jumpy and stutters.  Pictures are often fuzzy, even in good lighting.  Video also has pauses and cutouts, even when filming at 720p.  It's a shame, because I'm sure it's capable of adequate imaging, but it just doesn't seem powerful enough to handle the camera app.  Acceptable results may be obtained if you can keep the phone as still as possible, but even then there's no guarantee of a decent quality, focused image.I am honestly impressed by this phone in terms of appearance, display and the Android 6.0 interface in a $60 phone that has AT&T; 4G LTE bands.  It paired and worked fine with my car and headphones.  Has a standard size micro SIM and micro SD, so it was easy to swap from my old phone.  Battery life has been good.  Call and speaker quality are typical of most phones. It really went far beyond my expectations in every regard except for the camera.  If it wasn't for the camera, I'd give it 5 stars for anything close to $100 or less.  Honestly I don't need higher resolution.  8MP is more than enough, and 720p works fine.  But this one can't even manage that at reasonable quality.  Still, it's perfect for a kid's phone or a backup phone.  It's also just fine for daily use, I just know to bring along a real camera if I think I might need one.  Also, if you wear polarized sunglasses, it will be almost completely unreadable holding it in portrait mode.  You will have to rotate to landscape mode to see the display.  Almost every other phone is the reverse or does not suffer this issue at all.The ads aren't too obtrusive.  I have a lock screen app, so it appears in front of the main ads.  When you swipe to remove the lock screen app image, you then have to swipe again to remove the Amazon ad splash screen.  There's also a home page ad, but you can move that to an alternate home screen so it's not on your main ones.",

You would not expect a $110 phone ($60 with Prime + Ads) to have this build quality, be this snappy and smooth, have great battery life, and be an all-around great performer.Screen is great if you're not a snob.Performance is stellar for the facts that 1) it's smooth and 2) it's quick. Android 6.0, the Mediatek processor, and 2 GB RAM seem to ensure this.Maybe also because of Android 6.0 or some magic BLU has worked, this phone's battery lasts a while. Probably not a lot of Pokemon Go or other 3D games but still great.All in all, I am really surprised by this thing. If BLU could design one with about 3000 mAh battery instead of 2500, better camera, and finger print sensor for ~$200, I'd be sold on that!",

I am clumsy...what can I say? I just have a cheap gel case on it and the phone was perfectly fine when I picked it up!It charges pretty quickly and holds a charge for a good while. I can't really say much on that though because of the number of battery draining apps I have.The ads on the lock screen are barely noticeable. I don't have a problem with them at all.The ONLY thing I have a slight issue with is the tones. There is not an alarm tone loud enough to wake me up other than the high pitched annoying default alarm clock ring one. The other tones are pretty quiet. Its not the fault of the phone speakers either, because my music played through the phone is LOUD.I honestly love this phone and find it to be outstanding for the price!Update: well... Holding up to my history of being terrible with phones...I have messed this one up. I dropped it under my chair and rocked forward on it on accident. It is noe slightly bent...

I have been very happy with this phone thus far. Its a very good looking phone, and quality is pretty nice for this price. Yes, the speaker on the back isn't good at all, and you can really only use it in a quiet environment to hear it well, but I mainly use headphones, so no issue for me. yes, the camera isn't as good as the high end phones, but what do you expect for $60. Its takes good enough pictures and videos to post up to social media sites, no doubt about that. Yes, it does have lockscreen ads, but they really aren't invasive. If you don't have any notifications the ad will be fullscreen, if you have a notification it will be a notification size ad instead. What I did was download accuweather and have a constant weather notification so all I get are notification size ads on the lockscreen, works fine for me. yes there are other ways to get rid of the ads, but really I can't be bothered. Battery life has been pretty good, I'm a heavy user and it lasts me all day, having to put in on the charger around 6 or 7 at night. All I mainly do is facebook, instagram, clash of clans, watch youtube, stream some spotify, stuff like that, and this phone does it easily.

I saw Amazon had some prime phones that worked somewhat like their Kindles with \"special offers\", saw this phone had pretty darn good specs for $50, was from a brand I had used and enjoyed before, and gave this phone a chance, and I am really glad I did! Now let's just be clear, this is not an iPhone or Samsung or any other $800+ phone, nor is it trying to be, but I would call you a liar if you would've told me this was a $60 phone! While I personally use an S7 Edge I still find 720p, especially at 5\", to be more than good enough for daily use, especially with such a vibrant amoled screen. The battery life is decent, although not large enough for me, it could definitely get you through a day. The material chose feels fantastic, a nice soft rubber feel. Despite some Amazon apps pre-installed that you would probably already use (Kindle, Amazon Store app, etc), there is no real bloatware to speak of and is more or less a stock android experience. Games and apps seems to perform great, with only some of the more high end games starting to show the price of this phone. Honestly I only have one glaring issue with this one, and that is the fact YouTube seems to only max out some videos at 480p, something hopefully Blu or Google fix in the future. Also, I hope to see an R2 HD with a bigger battery, perhaps a bigger and 1080p screen, 5ghz wifi support, and NFC, although none of these are exactly necessary. Overall it was great gift for my brother and I am actually kind of jealous I did get and extra one for myself even though I don't need it!

    "text": "My last phone was the 1st gen Moto X from 2013. Ever since it was upgraded to Lollipop, it slowed down and the battery life drained noticably quicker. It also randomly crashed, and when it did, it would take a long time for Android to recompile itself. I almost missed a very important interview because of such an incident. That's when I realized my 3-4 year Moto X needed to be retired.The R1 HD came at just the right time. While I do miss a couple features from the Moto X, like the camera-on with a shake, motion sensor/quick info, and the nice OLED screen, the R1 (16gb/2ram) plainly operates faster.Yes, the speaker is on the lower side, and it would have helped if it were front facing. Definitely can't DJ a party with it, BUT I can still get by a speakerphone conversation in a low noise setting, as well as listen to navigation commands from maps or waze.Yes, there are ads, but they're so small on both the drop down and unlock screen that I rarely mind them at all.Additionally, I thought I might have trouble using an adapter for my nano-sim card to micro-size - I've seen other online ruining their phones using such adapters upon insert with the sim cards getting stuck. However the sim-card slot on the R1 isn't a slide-in insert, it's a drop down and lock style - On a hinge. So the sim-card was very easy to install. Awesome!Overall, I've found the Blu R1 HD a great value! If this phone were to be damaged, at least it's affordable again. I hope Amazon and Blu continue this partnership for future iterations of this phone line.",

Popped in my AT&T; sim and a spare 32GB TF and all good.  Just needed to sign in to my accounts.  Quite frankly I will never buy an $800 phone again after using this.  The expensive screens are beautiful.  Until you drop it.  This phone cost less than a screen replacement.  It's fast and does everything.  No brainer.  Pokemon Go is a Go.Update!!!!! Ok, after some use, I have a better idea of what you get my only real concern.Hardware: Solid. It runs and runs and runs without need for a reboot.  Runs runs every app so far.  Does it fast.  No possible complaint there.  Software too.  So where is the compromise?  Everything works.  Better than anything close.  Better than most unlocked new phones 3 or 4 times as much.  The biggest compromises are the camera and the battery.  Camera is adequate.  You wont miss the moment.  Just not great.  Battery is also mediocre.  A big part of it seems the length of time it can take to charge are the add updates.  They pop on screen briefly while plugged in and on wifi.  Just go into airplane mode and but it on a high amperage charger.  It' really does it all well enough for me.Only time will tell about longevity.  At this quality and price point I will be ok with getting another.What really scares me is how much Google knows about my life.  The adds are poniant.  Stuff I do want to buy.  That is beneficial for both of us. But a phone number and GPS is screaming for abuse.",

    "text": "Fantastic phone at $60! Coming from a Moto X 2014, I never thought I could have a 5-inch Android phone for this cheap. The phone has a good amount of developer support (easy to unlock, root, etc.), but due to the MediaTek processor, there haven't been any custom ROMs available.Battery life is great (easily lasts a whole day), screen is adequate (doesn't pop like an AMOLED screen, as expected, but overall no complaints), runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and solid build of a rubbery textured back coupled with a metal mid-frame.With that being said, there are a couple huge drawbacks:- The camera is mediocre-to-bad. Don't expect to be taking any award-winning photographs, especially in low light.- The speaker is bad. At high volumes, there is some noise and distortion. It also gets very muffled if the phone is sitting on a flat surface face-up.- There is no noise-cancellation on the microphone. I was speaking to someone in a grocery store, and we ended up postponing our conversation until later because she could only hear the background noise of the store and couldn't hear what I was saying.Overall, this is a great phone for cheap, especially if you broke your phone trying to replace the irreplaceable battery by yourself and need a new phone temporarily to get you by.",

    "text": "The price sort of sets the expectation on a product. So I wanted a backup phone for my international sims and decided to bite the dust on the 16GB version.On paper the specs were adequate and the dual sim with a 5\" HD display and marshmallow sets the right base.Reality: The packaging and presentation of the phone was really nice. The feel of the phone and materials used doesn't bequeath the price. Added a 64GB expandable memory that I had as spare.The performance is very good. No lag or stuttering. They were smart to go with the 5\" screen. With 720P the clarity was top notch. Of course you can't expect rendering and tonality to the level of a top end android or iPhone. But hey nothing to complain. It is quite usable. The audio is not very loud and the speaker placement also makes you cover it with your hand when it is held. But you can make your palm curved to direct it your way to better the audio direction.The overall size and metal parts give a nice feel in the hands and the buttons click nicely. It is also extremely light. In standby mode it is lasting me 3-4 days on light use.Drawback: the camera is really not upto the mark. Maybe different app can take more out of as the bundled one can't do anything. Need to test it that way and report. Both cams have very soft and over saturated photo quality. I don't think the target use case will suffer as this is not my primary phone.The Amazon ads are amusing or annoying as you look at it. But for 50$ less it is worth to live with it. Also they only intrude in the lock screen and if you are used to the kindle it is no big deal.Summary: I like it and recommend it to anyone who wants it as a second phone or gift it to someone in your family or to a friend.",

If you are a person that doesn't need the best phone in the market, then the BLU R1 HD will do you just fine.Having had used this phone for a while, it definitely performs all the things I need it to do. Watching YouTube videos, browsing the web and having multiple webpages open, they both work fine. These are a few of the things that I use my phone for and I'm sure many others do too.My only gripe with this phone is that the camera is quite terrible. It isn't really good at taking selfies or taking photos in general for that matter. You can see comparison photos of two shots, one taken by my iPhone 5 and the other by the BLU R1 HD. The first photo is the shot taken on my iPhone 5. The latter is by the BLU R1 HD.The battery life is quite decent. If you're not a super heavy user, the phone should last you more than 3/4 of your day or till your bedtime.Overall, you will be getting a LOT of phone for your money. I recommend the 2gb ram version too. It will do the trick. I just wish that the phone had more accessories. Had more reliable companies creating screen protectors and cases for this phone. So if you don't want to spend a lot of money, and you don't really need a good camera on your phone, can live without a fingerprint sensor, then this phone is a good bet!",

As far as I can tell, none of them are running in the background or slowing down the phone.* The OS is not quite stock Android, but feels reasonably close. A couple of UI tweaks, but nothing distracting.* The camera is acceptable but definitely not great: it's fine to snap a quick picture, but noticeably worse than a high-end phone (or DLSR).* The battery lasts a surprisingly long time: I usually have about 60% charge remaining after returning from work, under light use (maybe ~1hr talking on Skype and another ~30 minutes reading articles+email, on average).* This phone does not have a compass!

I'd dare say it's on the upper end of what I expect from a mid-range phone, and at this price I can forgive a lot of the features that separate it from many flagships. I am sincerely impressed with what Blu has achieved here, and with Amazon subsidizing such a big chunk of it this phone is a no brainer, just make sure you spring for the version with 2gb of RAM. The screen is impressive, it's quite vivid for something that isn't AMOLED or Quantum LCD. Apps are snappy and rarely stutter unless you're multi-tasking or playing something graphically intensive. Amazon's apps are unobtrusive and the Android experience is close enough to stock to keep me happy. I got this phone for a relative but I'm impressed enough that if my phone were to die on me today I'd probably pick up one of these rather than pay ten times as much for a new flashship. There's just not enough of a gap between this and anything up on offer from LG, Samsung, or Motorola that I'd feel compelled to spend that much again.",

The ear piece gets fairly loud, but I'd advice the hearing impaired to look elsewhere. Text messages, email, and general web browsing is great.The screen gets plenty bright, and viewing angles are great. Performance is pretty good, with an odd stutter here and there, but nothing too concerning. The biggest issue I have with this device is gaming.Games like Pokemon Go work just fine, as long as the AR mode is disabled, but anything that requires precise movement like Sky Force 2014, or Dead Trigger 2 will be frustrating as the screen doesn't track touches as accurately as it should, however, this can be circumvented by using a controller.Overall it's a pretty solid device, and the most important thing to remember is the price.

I use it for everything. I joined my public library and now can download e books and audio books free. Please support your public library its a dying breed. I also suggest you get a vpn which is a service that encrypts your phone so if you are on public wifi no one can snoop. I use PIA with a year service it ends up $ 3.33 a month well worth the hassle of someone cracking your bank account. All and All you can't go wrong with this phone.",

    "text": "First off, the phone is fantastic, FAST, unbelievable gem for the pricepoint. My only complaint so far is that the media speaker isn't very loud compared to other devices.  Other reviewers have been spot on as far as pros so I will fast forward to trying to use this as a $7 Tracfone device.I bought this and a $1 tracfone byop kit as a backup Android phone to my iPhone 5s-- especially for hands-free stuff in the car, Android wins by a loooong shot.  So when I called Tracfone today they said the IMEI I provided from the phone resulted in an \"error\" and sorry but they could not help me as the phone is not compatible.  The rep said maybe I could try online and sometimes that works even though a rep can't get it activated. I then had a lightbulb moment and took the sim card out of my current activated backup tracfone  (Alcatel one touch sonic $14.99 on Amazon) and put that sim card (ATT towers) into the R1 HD.  I had to turn some sim card settings on and restart the phone and not only did it work PERFECTLY..... so did the wifi hotspot!  I have never seen a Tracfone with a functioning wifi hotspot before this.  I have not tried the rep's suggestion of setting it up online yet because I am so relieved to have a hotspot for travel again.  I just wanted to share this discovery--that you can just put an active ATT/Tracfone sim in and it will work with a bonus hotspot to boot----I have tested the hotspot and it works blazing fast too.  :-)  If I have any problems with this setup, I will post an update.  And just to clarify, I used nothing from the BYOP kit.",

    "text": "I only bought this phone for one reason, to deliver for my job. My job requires an android and I have an iPhone so I needed something cheap, hopefully reliable and asap.This phone is great with one exception, it keeps freezing up on me when I deliver to certain areas, Bluetooth always seems to disconnect and the speaker on the phone is not loud at all.My roommate and I share the same plan which is T-MOBILE and his phone only has a problem in the area over by what is known as the \"dead zone\" which is by Red Rock Canyon and that's because T-Mobile doesn't have service up there. Other than that he never has problems with his android phone.The Blu phone always seems to freeze up and I have to start all over again with the program. At first I thought it was their app that kept freezing up but my roommate, who works the same job, worked that same area as well and his phone was fine. Never froze up on him.Also this phone also has a problem with scanning barcodes and it barely will scan a square barcode.The phone is not loud at all when you put it on speaker so I bought a Bluetooth speaker for it and sometimes it has connection problems with the speaker. For some reason it will stop connecting to the Bluetooth speaker and you have to either turn off your Bluetooth on the phone and then turn it back on to reconnect or do the same for the speaker as well.I gave this phone 3 stars because it isn't a bad phone overall, it does it's job like all other phones do, and you can't beat the price but it's not a good phone for what I do which is making deliveries and scanning any barcodes.I would recommend this phone for people that are looking for a decent priced phone, that looks great and does it's duty as any android phone can do. It's just not for people who travel around a lot  because it will freeze on you or likes to scan items whether it be for your job, at stores or at your home. It just takes forever for it to scan a barcode, especially the square ones. And if you want to use the speaker on this phone in your car, you definitely can't have your air on, windows down, or your music playing, the speaker is just not loud enough unless you use a Bluetoothand even then it will continue to disconnect then reconnect on you.Maybe it's just my phone that's having all these problems because I do recommend this phone to people who want a phone that does work for regular website browsing, phone calls, emails, and other simple things you need for a phone to do. I haven't tried games on it yet but like I mentioned above the speaker is not loud enough.I only use it for work, typing this review and the battery seems to run down quick as it's doing right now.I really do like this phone but it has problems that I can't have. I think it'd be a great phone even for someone's first Android. It's just not for me and the things I need it to do.",

When taking price into consideration, it's easily 5/5.

If not? Disable them - no issues at all. This phone comes with a charging brick and a cord - that's it. None of the other usual Blu \"goodies\" are in the box (no screen protector/case/headphones). It is unfair to rate the phone a 1 or 2 star review for not including these. They are not listed as included.I have owned a Galaxy S6 Edge and an Iphone 6s. I am a bit tired of reading 1 and 2 star reviews which compare this phone to a flagship. Is this phone as snappy, crisp, etc as one of my other phones? No, but it is unfair to compare it to those.

I was originally on the fence with the model that has ads on the phone as I was worried it might be annoying; but to my surprise you barely even know it's there and it's only on the login screen.The camera is mediocre and can be a bit difficult by default. But for me I just turned on sports mode and was able to adapt to the lack of a high shutter speed. If you can get it the images properly  focused actually come out pretty decent.Not sure what the standards for battery life but I can go a full day without charging and that's with about 1-2 hours of watching youtube with wifi / bluetooth / location enabled. Just download an app to clean your phone periodically and you should be okay as apps these days tend to hog a lot of resources in the background.The signal quality is also pretty good. I had an old Nokia Lumia phone and was not able to get reception while in Lincoln tunnel but this one miraculously has been able to.

The sides and the buttons look like some kind of extra tough plastic that easily get passed as metal (or are they?). Only the underside is of a softer kind of plastic does not feel premium, but nevertheless it fits very tightly. One your hand the feeling is very solid and satisfying.The screen resolution and colors are great. Good quality IPS LCD that renders colors vividly and beautifully. Everything is pleasure to look at in this screen. As compared to an iPhone 7, which I also own, text may look a bit more smoothed-out but it is still perfectly readable and beautiful.16GB of storage is small for today's requirements but it can accept SD Cards above 32GB (mine is working with a ultra fast 64GB Lexar 150Mbps). That, coupled with Android's 6 capability of merging SD Card and internal storage in a single pool completely eliminates the storage shortcomings.2GB of RAM is a steal. That's the same amount of RAM the iPhone 6S and 7 come with. Very important for keeping many apps running, of for opening many web pages at once.The cameras are pretty nice - not premium but very decent. And it includes a front flash!The only very middling components are the processor and 3D chip. You can notice a small lag in some apps, but nothing that compromises use. The operating system and interface run very smoothly.I ran an Antutu Benchmark (a pretty much universally used benchmark score app) on it and the performance placed it between the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy S4. But that only measures speed. On top of it, this unit has 2GB of RAM, which gives it more stamina for holding many apps open.Bottom line, this is probably the best of the cheapest smartphones out there. It is already a good deal at the unsubsidized price of US$109. At US$59, this is a steal!",

It is well built (does not feel cheap), has snappy response, good size display and comes with Android 6 (Marshmallow).  At the full price I think this phone is a great bargain, but at the reduced price with ads it's a steal.  The ads only appear on the lock screen, they don't show up anywhere else.  The ads take up the entire lock screen unless there are notifications. I use a weather app (WeatherBug) that keeps a widget on the lock screen so the ads take up no more room that a regular notification, I don't really notice them.  Some other reviewers have commented on the number of pre-installed Amazon apps that cannot be uninstalled.  I don't find this to be an issue, I simply disable the apps I don't need.  As for taking up storage, by using a Micro SD card set up as permanent storage it becomes a non issue. While on the subject of storage, there is no reason to purchase the 8GB model.  As for performance., my wife has a Samsung Galaxy 4 S and aside from the lower resolution, the BLUE R1 HD performs as well at a much better price. I only have two issues with the phone.  The quality of the pictures from the rear facing camera are not on par with the quality of the phone.  They are acceptable, however if you are an avid \"phone photographer\" you may be disappointed.  The second issue, which is rather insignificant, is that I find the body of the phone to be too smooth. I dropped the phone several times when I first received it.  My previous phone, a Moto G LTE, had a non-slip body which was very nice.  I recommend buying the BLU ArmorFlex Case for this phone, it is a non-slip case that protects the phone and is well made.  All in all, if your looking for a quality unlocked phone at a budget phone price I don't think you can go wrong with this phone.",

    "text": "This phone is awesome for $60 bucks. Screen is crystal clear, and it runs quickly (at least on the 2GB model). My only reservation was that the Prime Ad Supported version had a locked bootloader, but as of this weekend, root and custom TWRP installation have been achieved, so the possibilities are now limitless. This phone it worth it, if for nothing more than to tinker with. So very impressed at this point, and can't speak highly enough about it. Only negative, as others have said, is the volume of the speaker, however, for $60, who cares? How many of us use their phone speakers regularly anyway?It does not have NFC or a gyroscope, but at this price, you would not expect to see either of them.Update: I did have one episode where I used a somewhat sketchy USB cable to charge it at my desk. Powered the phone off, and put it on the cable, immediately it attempted to power up and the white Blu Screen popped up and shut off every 3 seconds until the battery was exhausted, and the phone would not shut down, or recognize any button presses, so no way to get into recovery, or anywhere else. Once the battery was exhausted, the phone booted up just fine, and is working properly.tl;dr Use a non-Blu charger and USB at your own risk, and if the continuous reboot issue occurs, once the battery dies, you should be good to go.",

    "text": "After using an HTC Evo 4G LTE for the better part of the last 4 years, I was in dire need of an upgrade, but was really tight on cash. Luckily I found this phone. I have heard good things about BLU's phones over the past year or two, so I figured it was worth a shot.Fortunately, the phone performs very well. The device features Android in almost stock form, which means the phone is not being held down by custom skins and additions that may hinder performance out of the box. The cheaper \"Prime\" version also features ads on the lock screen. They're rather unobtrusive and much of the time, I forget they're even there. If it's a nuisance to you though, you could always root and install a stock ROM or CyanogenMod, which is very simple to do.The phone is also built surprisingly well, featuring an aluminium body and Gorilla Glass. The only \"cheap\" part would be the plastic back cover, but even still, it doesn't feel like it will break without intentionally applying force. The screen looks great, and although it's only 1280x720p, the PPI is high enough that when held at a normal distance from your eyes, everything looks clean and sharp. The phone also features \"MiraVision\", where you can make your own adjustments to the brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, etc. I used a few THX patterns from Google image search and got the screen pretty well calibrated now. The screen has a bit of \"black crush\" out of the box, so at the very least, adjustments need to be made in the brightness level there.Unfortunately, there is one drawback to a phone this cheap: The rear camera. Sadly, the front 5 megapixel camera often takes cleaner pictures than the 8 megapixel lens in the back. I would gladly have paid an additional $10 for an upgraded rear camera with a better lens, even if it were the same 8MP resolution. I will have to continue to play around with the settings in Open Camera (one of the more fully featured cameras on the Play store) to see if I can squeeze any more quality out of it.The phone also plays all of the games I've tossed at it so far with little to no hiccups, including \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\", which runs very well. You should have no problems playing your favorite games on this device, which makes it's \"$60 with Prime\" price point that much sweeter.Whether you're looking for a decent phone to use as a daily driver, or maybe a cheap phone for the kids to play their favorite games on, if you're on a tight budget, and having a mediocre rear camera is of no bother to you, then BLU's R1 HD is a definite contender.",

In order to switch my Tracfone service to this phone I had to order a sim card (99 cents) from Tracfone and follow the normal phone switch procedure.

    "text": "I really love this phone, especially for the price. The ads are not intrusive at all.  However after having the phone for about a week, suddenly it has started responding to phantom swipes and clicks.  I mean I'll put down the phone and suddenly it will launch an app that I wasn't trying to launch.  It launched the same app on me 3 times today when the phone was sitting on my desk.  I finally rebooted the phone and it seemed to stop.  Then later today it phantom dialed the phone number of someone that had texted me, again when the phone was on the table next to me - twice.  I think perhaps it is somehow caching swipes and touches or something.  It's quite disconcerting.The other issue is the speaker - while the clarity is good, the volume isn't.  Even with the 'Outdoor' loudest setting and the volume turned all the way up, it is too low to be able to hear on a phone call in the car - even if the car isn't moving, never mind if you're actually driving.  Even hearing Google Maps directions is a bit challenging, and I've got the Google Map Voice Level setting to 'Louder', which is highest you can go.Other than that the phone is great, it has a great feel to it, it's mostly responsive.  I was blown away by the quality of the screen, watching MLB At Bat I felt like I was in the stadium.  This is really a tremendous value - assuming the phantom swipes don't become a regular occurrence.  Would have been a 5 star review except for that and the sound volume issue.",

Compared to the Galaxy S4 I was using it's just a fast from the lock screen to running apps, slimmer, and the display is beautiful with the curved glass. I equipped the phone with a\u00a0BLU R1 HD ArmorFlex Case + Screen Protector - White/Gold\u00a0for a case, a\u00a0SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC UHS-I Card with Adapter, Grey/Red, Standard Packaging (SDSQUNC-064G-GN6MA)\u00a0in it for use as internal storage, AND on top of everything else it has worked perfectly with a\u00a0FreedomPop Global Talk, Text, & Data w/ 3-in-1 SIM Kit\u00a0to use FreedomPop as my carrier!Pros:* Slim Profile* Curved Glass, Bright Display, and Vivid Colors* Glass is smooth to the touch. Not sticky feeling and not a fingerprint magnet.* Dual Camera w/ Dual Flash* Dual SIM* Unlocked* Useable with FreedomPop* External SD Card can be used as Internal Storage* Amazon LOCKSCREEN Ads are not Intrusive* CHEAPCons:* Back of phone has a tad rubbery grip feeling (personal preference)* Phone was picky about the brand and size of SD Card I used. I tried many Samsung Class 10 and UHS-1 cards that ended up not working. Worked perfectly with all SanDisk UHS-1 cards I put in though.* SIM Slot 1 gave me problems with the FreedomPop GSM SIM. SIM Slot 2 works perfectly.FreedomPop Setup:I was worried I wouldn't be able to setup the FreedomPop SIM because of other people having issues setting it up. I have to say that it was pretty straight forward. The instructions that came with the FreedomPop GSM SIM were correct however it missed a few things so i'm going to list the instructions below in 10 easy steps.Step 1 - Download the \"FreedomPop Messaging\" app from the Google Play Store.Step 2 - Insert the FreedomPop GSM SIM into SIM Slot 2 and lock it down.Step 3 - Go the \"Settings\" -> \"... More\" -> \"Cellular networks\".Step 4 - Turn on \"Data roaming\".Step 5 - Click \"Access Point Names\"Step 6 - Click the + in the upper right corner.Step 7 - Set Name to \"FreedomPop\", set APN to \"freedompop.foggmobile.com\", set APN type to \"default\" and \"dun\".Step 8 - Click the 3 dots in the upper right corner and click \"Save\".Step 9 - Select \"FreedomPop\" as your new APN and click the back arrow.Step 10 - Restart your phone.I guess another step would be making sure you activate your new GSM SIM card on FreedomPop's website but that's simple enough and it only cost me $0.01 to activate it.Overall I would say that I am very pleased with my purchase and am actually planning on getting a few more of these phone with the FreedomPop GSM SIM kits for family members.",

    "text": "This is an amazing phone for the price!  I would definitely recommend splurging for the extra 10$ to get the higher spec'd version.  The 16GB version has 2GB of memory, versus the 1GB found in the 8GB model.  First off, there are ways to remove the adds from the lockscreen and I believe it can be done by simply using a different lockscreen app.  The adds themselves are not intrusive to me so I left them alone, I like how it changes my lock screen to different pictures anyway.  Sometimes for example if listening the Pandora, the artist background is larger so you barely even notice the amazon ads anyway.  Moving on, this phone is a solid performer.  I don't play many games, although I tried a few racing games such as Asphalt and performance was very good!  You can't expect flagship level performance from this phone but it certainly gets the job done.  I cannot stress the 2GB of ram enough, I previously had a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime with only 1GB.  It was constantly reaching the max with running apps which caused massive slowdown.  This phone barely gets to around 1GB, leaving an extra gigabyte of free space which helps it zip along.  I am also impressed with the battery life, you can easily achieve more than a full day with moderate use.  Build quality is great, the phone has a premium feel although I would still recommend a case.  Mainly due to the large camera lense protruding on the back.  The camera on this phone is very snappy to me and produces decent shots.  I haven't played around with the settings too much but the basic app has the functionality I would expect.  Another bonus I would say for this phone is the green message indicator light, I missed this on previous phones so you nailed it with that feature BLU!",

I am not the fancy hipster kiddo in the future type so it works for me. The camera is alright but then again I have a DSLR for pictures.

I have T-mo as my carrier. Blu said that soon after release we would get an ota update to include Band 12. So far I've had 2 updates, but band 12 is still not there.

It also had issues with the sound profiles always switching back to the main \"general\" profile, even after being switched to \"silent\" or \"do not disturb.\" This resulted in hearing notification sounds and vibrations overnight.Should those two issues have been resolved, this easily would've been a 5-star purchase. My unit may have just been defected, but again, if these issues weren't present, it would've made it the best smartphone deal around.",

I have a personal iPhone 6s, but I've been enjoying my experience with the R1 HD so much, I put my iPhone sim in the BLU phone and took advantage of the dual sim capability. Love it. It's fantastic not to have to carry around 2 phones, and it's been easy to switch back and forth between my 2 numbers (with 2 different carriers).As for the phone itself, the display is crisp and bright; the performance is snappy (I have the 16GB, 2GB version) and phone calls have been really clear and smooth.

I tried textplus go plan they have for 9.99 a month and nothing..the phone would find the sim but even after putting in the APN info it never found the network..I am happy to say it does work great with ATT and others who use the ATT network like tracfone..",

I bought the phone to use on a trip overseas for two reasons, dual sim cards and price, if I lose or break it i'm not out a lot of money. I also like the size of the phone a lot, I have a nexus 6P which I have gotten used to but going to a smaller phone can be nice at times, fits my hand better, I can use one hand to do anything on the phone whereas the nexus I would sometimes need both hands. If the BLU supported CDMA it would be perfect, I would use t-mobile for everything and keep a prepaid verizon sim in the second slot for when I'm in rural areas where nothing else has signal. I did use this phone to do a comparison between t-mobile and att which was nice since I didn't need two phones and wasn't also comparing the quality of the antenna in each phone, just the service.",

I will post pictures taken with this camera indoors and outdoors just so you have an idea of what to expect with this purchase. At this price point I'm definitely not complaining... Using apps, playing games, surfings the net runs pretty smoothly with little to no lag. Having the ads on the lock screen takes a bit of getting use to but is not as bad as I thought it would be.

    "text": "This phone is everything I'd hoped it would be and more.  I researched heavily and read everything about it, including all 1000 questions and answers.  I noticed lots of queries about whether it would work with the safelink/tracfone system.  It does and does the job perfectly.  I'm used to having real crappy phones with my lifeline system.  With the R1 HD, those days are a thing of the past.  First thing you do is buy the Tracfone BYOP(Bring your own phone) kit at any Wally world or here on line for less than ten bucks.  Then get a high speed 32 or 64 gig SD card, cause you'll use it.  If you download ES file explorer and turn on \"allow outside apps\", you'll be able to move anything you want over to the SD card with no problem.  The phone is a GSM system phone.  Take out the ATT sim card from the BYOP packet and punch out the micro sim section.  Go online with your home computer and google \"Blu R1 HD User Manual\" and then download it or bookmark it.  On page 3 you'll see an exploded view of the open back of the phone.  When opening up the SD and sim compartments you must first slide the metal piece about 1/16' up and it will clamshell open.  Once the sims are inserted close it and slide it back to lock it closed.  The manual goes into much greater detail than the little  booklet they give you with the phone.  Do no install the sims yet.  but the SD card can go in.  Getting the back off is a challenge.  it is hooked on at many small points.  I start at the middle bottom of the phone and get a fingernail under it and slowly move the fingernail around the edge between the top and bottom until it just releases.  You'll hear small pops as the back cover slowly releases it's attach points.  I've taken the cover off at least 6 times now with no problems with this method.  Do not try to pry it open from a corner.  It will crack and break.  Once the cover is off and the sim cards are laid out both ATT and T-Mobile (both GSM) call safelink customer service at 800-378-1684.  Go through the menus, which will be press 2, press 6, press 5, press 2, and you will get human tech on the line.  Don't use a cell phone use a landline for this process.  It took 5 minutes for the tech to take down the sim # and transfer all my lifeline minutes to the R1 HD.  It took 20 minutes on hold to get the tech though.  The phone worked flawless for incoming and outgoing.  One thing I was missing.  The home screen on my old tracfone always showed me how many minutes I had left.  I downloaded the tracfone app in google play and it loaded on page two of the home page and it shows you how much data, voice and text you have remaining.  It is very slow to update though.  A better way is to just dial *777*1#(star777star1pound) on your R1 HD and safelink immediately sends a message to you with the exact usage and remaining useage.  This phone does everything, but then maybe all the smart phones do, I wouldn't know,  but I'll bet they don't do it for 59.99.I decided to stretch.  I hooked up a plantronics M70 bluetooth headset and it is fantastic.  All I do now is grab my phone, go to voice recognition and say \"Call Dottie\" and walk out of the room and it calls Dottie.  I don't have to be anywhere near the phone. I can initiate the call with the earpiece and have a whole conversation with the phone nowhere near me..So I said to myself ,\"Why not?\"  I went to Wally world and bought a tracfone prepaid card for 200 voice, 500 text and 200mb of data for 15$.  I purchased another tracfone card for 1000 texts for 5$ and called safelink customer service back.  In ten minutes they had the t mobile sim in the phone in slot two, all the prepaid cards loaded and an entire separate number just for my 4 teenage grand daughters.  Teenagers hate to talk on the phone.  For them, It's totally uncool.  They love to text though.  Now I'll be texting them on my #2simm card number every day and night.  So for under 90 dollars I get 550 minutes voice over 2000 texts and 500meg of data, and two phone numbers and a great phone.  With the phone paid for, I'll get the same amounts every month for 20.00.  I love it and I highly recommend this phone.  If your old phone uses micro GSM sims then you can save 8 bucks by just inserting the sims from your old phone into the new one.  If you don't have teenage grand daughters who are texting freaks then don't bother with the second phone number but if you're on a lifeline program that uses a GSM network system, get this phone, you won't be sorry.  It works and works better than any one of the stock phones they want you to use.Hope this review helps some folks, especially seniors, who may be sitting on the fence because of the service they use.  No need to worry, this phone does it all for you.",

It is rather an impressive phone for the cost, actually. My daughter has many games on it now that all play very well and she enjoys taking pictures of everything in the house. The battery last a long time. The lack of a lot of the bloatware that is present on my note 4 is lovely. Amazon apps haven't been intrusive at all. Ordered the 7$ case and screen protector for it also. I completely messed up the protector because I'm terrible at putting them on, but the case is very protective and highly suggested.",

When I first got the phone the ads weren't too bad, but seem to have increased. At times I have to swipe through three screens of ads before being able to get to the homepage on the phone, which can be annoying. The phone has slight delays when compared to my previous Asus Zenphone 2, but to be expected. Design is great on the phone, but definitely pick up a case as this screen cracked the easiest of any phone I have used in the past. Quality is better than expected for the price.",

I never go for anything expensive but do not like to settle too much either. I have owned Sony Experias, LG G series phones, Moto X, Meizu M2, Samsung Galaxy series (the cheaper ones :P ) and many more which I do not remember! This one really matches the performance of Moto X in my opinion. The thing I love the most about this phone is stock android. It has not disappointed me in 8 hours of use. The ads dont bother me that much (yet) The camera is not too bad.The only thing I do not like is the word BLU written so big on front, if that wasn't written, this phone would look super sexy! Whenever people asked me today whats BLU, I got bored to explain \"Oh, its a new phone launched by Amazon Prime which is quite cheap if you get the ad version, etc etc\" Life would have been simple if the brand wasn't written on , haha, but its not that of an issue.

This is her FIRST smartphone and the phone is easy to use with a little assistance from someone who knows how to operate a smartphone already (:The reason for 4 stars is because there's no physical buttons built into the phone to go back, go to the home screen, or show running apps.

Also my at&t; visual voicemail no longer works but I found an app to take care of that.The things I love: the screen quality is great and its perfect for reading, it functions fast so multitasking is a breeze, and it's awesome to have expandable storage again.Overall this is a great second phone, in between upgrades phone or a great first phone for kids.

The first indication of trouble was the rapid mid-morning battery drain. Then my mobile data usage got excessive. My Motorola Roadster II hands-free started acting erratic. (No virus just Amazon Crapware.) All this started after another lock screen showed up after I unlocked the normal one with ads. This one demanded that I sign into my account. I tap the link to sign in and am confronted with a blank white screen. I dismiss these and go about my business. It kept happening which got very annoying. I travel a lot and need my hands-free to be hands-free but when the second lockscreen is active it stops working until that lockscreen is dismissed. Sort of defeats the hands-free if I have to fumble around and unlock the phone. Contacted Amazon who referred me to BLU who said it was Amazon's software and to contact them. I solved the problem. I purched a Moto G4 Play for $94.95 from B&H; Photo in New York. Now my battery life is better than any phone I've ever owned. data usage is back to normal and hands-free is hands-free again. When I get time, I want to root the R1HD and de Amazon it. I do like the phone. A $50 discount is not enough. If it is just a few ads on a lockscreen yeah. But, there is more involved. Certain settings of the phone are locked. The amount of Amazon Crapware on the phone is staggering. Not having a junked up locked down phone will be the best $50 you ever spent.",

We bought it just to use as a small gaming tablet for our kids, and they love it.  The screen is great. The build quality is great. I really like the curved edges of the glass screen - it actually gives the phone a high end look and feel. The processor is snappy. The camera is only so-so, but that's not what we use it for.  We have found the Amazon ads to be minimally intrusive, so we're glad to have bought the discounted version.Haven't even tried a SIM in the phone yet, so I don't know how it performs on a network, but on wifi, it's great.",

It works like it should and the whole half price with ads is a great deal if you already have Amazon prime.The ads aren't a big deal. If you don't have any notifications at the time the lock screen gives you a full screen ad for something. If you do have a notification there's a small ad at the bottom of them. At the second screen of your home menu there's also an ad. But honestly I have already got so use to them, because they are not imposing, I don't even notice them any more.Highly recommended.

It is fast, very built well, and arrives with Android 6.0. Besides the Amazon ads, it provides a near-stock vanilla Android experience.

In summation: the BLU R1 HD's build quality is impressive, the 5\" screen is bright and clear, the specs are nice but the rear-facing speaker and very low-quality camera are negatives, making this $60 smartphone with Amazon ads a solid 4 star smartphone.",

I did have some problems with the phone re setting the time to be either 2 hours ahead or 2 hours behind. It would also reboot repeatedly and my lock code would not work when entered correctly. It was only a one time event so far. The Gorilla glass is a joke. I dropped the phone once and the entire screen shattered. It's a shame that you can only order 1 per Prime membership, I have to have a friend order one for me now. Amazon, you should at least come up with an upgrade-able insurance policy on the phone.

I have straight talk using at&t; network. I did have to buy a new SIM card because my old one from my galaxy wasn't micro. But that was the only frustrating part because I had to wait for my new SIM card so that I could use my phone. So if you order this phone, check your SIM card so that if you have to get a new one, it will arrive the same day as your new awesome phone.I love that I can use this as my own personal wifi hotspot. Now I can use my tablet anywhere. As some others wrote, the sound isn't the best but you can easily fix that with an app.The camera is fine for my purposes, which is capturing things in the moment.And I have taken some really good pictures with it so far.I would say, as others have said, that this is a great phone for the price, but I think that this would be a great phone even at a much higher price.",

    "text": "I cannot believe this phone is being sold at this price.  It genuinely represents the best value in cell I have ever seen.  Period.  The display is not as sharp as some and Hasselblad has nothing to fear from the camera.  But it is reasonably snappy, light but solid, the build quality is amazing regardless of price, and functions like a phone should.  I mean, my 6P doesn't have a front-facing flash like this does!The one inexcusable choice Amazon made is to neuter Google apps.  For instance, even though I pay for Google Play music and can log in with my account I cannot import any of my existing playlists nor download music to the device for offline listening.  Come on, Amazon!  I know you want to push people to your own services but even APPLE lets you natively do these things on iPods/iPads/iPhones. If your goal is revenue generation via a partially-walled garden you're just going to end up driving people to root the phones and install another OS.I bought this to function as an Android-sourced iPod alternative so I could install my workout apps and download music to listen to while jogging.  The inability to accomplish that second step (without paying for data while streaming music) is just about a deal breaker.  The irony being I also subscribe to Prime and have used Amazon's music service since it was introduced and would have continued to use those apps without the Google Play restriction.  All you've done is made me SUPER annoyed.Update: I found the handset would not display the correct time (always two hours behind) even though the time settings were for network time and location. Ordered a replacement and did a factory reset (time still showed wrong after reset). Messing around with it tonight, manually set time and zone then switched back to network driven and now it seems to be correct. Also now shows me the option to download music from my Play playlists. Must have been a beck of a glitch in the OS.Update 10-17:  This thing has some quirks.  I am still only using this as a music player and exercise tracker.  The battery life is not very good.  The phone will fully discharge after being turned off in about 4 days.  What is more weird is having turned off mobile data (still with no SIM installed), turned off wifi, turned on airplane mode, and then shut the phone off, I will still receive new email notification via the flashing light.  HOW CAN THAT BE???  I have tried this multiple times with the same result every time.  There should be no reason the phone is scanning wifi while off, much less in airplane mode with wifi disabled.  Even if I leave the phone on in airplane mode with wifi off I will still get email notifications.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "So I used the phone for 3 weeks.  Absolutely loved it.  Then I dropped it for the first time when my arm was hit by a car door.  It shattered the glass on the screen.  Powers up everything is fine, but the touch screen is a no go.  So yes I acknowledge this is my fault, I dropped it.  So I was willing to buy a replacement, since I had to do phone interviews on Tuesday (this was Sunday).  I tried to order and found they had a limit on the phones per account, I was guessing so people couldn't bulk order them.  So I contacted amazon via chat (since this phone was my only phone), after talking with the employee for about 30 minutes it was revealed there was nothing I could do.  I cannot exchange the phone, send it in to repair (wasn't even asking for that) NOR could I buy a replacement.  I'd have to either buy a different phone or \"open a new account\" I then pointed out I'd have to get prime on that new account, because the phone is exclusive for prime members, which means it would be cheaper to just get a different phone...  The only other option was to contact someone didn't already have the phone and who had an amazon prime account to order me replacement.  Problem is most of my friends already bought the phone the same time I did...  So yeah... Kind of screwed.So anyway, this is a highly personal experience, I put it up here so people are aware if you break this phone, there is absolutely nothing you can do to replace it outside of getting a completely different phone.  So hang onto it for dear life.The phone itself is good, the ads are generally un-intrusive and it's speedy, plays any app that doesn't require a gyroscope, so yeah Pokemon Go works, but not with AR camera mode on.  There is literally nothing bad I can say about it, other than it's a touch heavy so if you drop it from any kind of distance your screen might shatter like mine did...  I'd suggest getting a screen protector and case just to make sure you don't suffer my fate.For comparison I have used the following list of phones and this has been the best so far at least as far as first impressions go: Fierce One Touch, Kyocera Icon, Asus Zenfone and a Nexus 4.",

Display is bright and graphics quality is say 8 out of 10 compared to other phones I have owned.Internet browsing is fast and can play videos in browser from mot web pages similar to a desktop.I got the 16 gb internal storage and added a 16gb micro sd card and have plenty of room for apps and pictures/videos. The camera is great and takes very clear photographs and videos for a $60 phone. The front camera is very clear also. Great for Skype, Facebook chat, Google hangouts video, etc.The touchscreen is fast and responsive with a basic screen protector on it.I opted for the 2gb of ram versus the 1gb ram and its worth it. I can run multiple apps simultaneously with no hanging.Overall very happy with this phone and the fact that Amazon is offering a subsidy for a few ads makes it even better!The BLU brand is an low cost, high quality device.

It can be a neat experience to see something new on each unlock, but it seemed to cycle the same ones, and the ads with white up top did effect the visibility of the clock, which I thought would have had a darker backdrop to avoid this issue.

I'm pretty cheap, so I was willing to get it at 50% off in return for seeing an ad during the half a second I'm on the lock screen (and it's not like they're annoying ads, just a different background for my clock & notifications).It works great, it's fast and has enough internal storage to let you install many apps (unlike my previous phone which had a max of about 5 apps, even if they let you move portions to the SD card).The feel of this is extremely luxurious.  The front is Corning's \"gorilla glass\" which doesn't come with a screen protector because it doesn't need one; it's scratch-resistant.  The back feels great but that's partly because it's slippery, so be careful -- if the surface you lay it on is at ALL uneven, it'll fall.  You NEED a case for this because that glass screen that's so resistant to scratches is NOT resistant to impact, and it will shatter. (although you can still technically use it if you don't mind a few glass shards in your fingers. Heh.)It's probably almost cheaper to get a whole new phone than a new screen, but I was raised in an era where we had things fixed, so I'm on the hunt for a new screen.

I purchased the ad-supported phone and honestly the ads aren't intrusive as I thought it would be. The lockscreen is a full size ad and usually changes with each visit. Amazon also includes a Deal of the Day Widget on one of the home screens. Pretty useful if you're a daily deal hunter and don't like the daily deal email spam or taking the time to visit the Amazon Homepage.Button Placement: Typical with Microsoft Lumia phones, the volume button is above the power button on the right side of the phone.microSIM: The microsim housing is somewhat flimsy in my opinion, using the locking door style instead of sliding in. I suppose it's ok as your sim card will never get stuck within a slot.Camera: The picture quality is average to \"whatever.\" From what I can tell, anywhere you click on the screen, the phone does a good job in focusing.Flashlight: The flashlight is easily accessible from the notifications menu and boy is it BRIGHT.Speaker: The speaker is located in the back of the phone.

That being said,  MS Windows just does not have the apps I want and need so I bought a BLU Studio C, again from A for the equivalent of $100 US and although it was OK with A5 the internal memory at 8 was becoming inadequate so I liked the look of this. Wellll, the phone is actually pretty, does not feel cheap and cost $109 US (I hate ads and even give money to Mozilla and Wikipedia among others). The Gorilla Glass is very sensitive compared to the Studio C but not up to the Nokia but nothing is (works with fingernails and heavy gloves). It's much thinner and lighter too. Android 6 is a much better program in every way than 5 and this is guaranteed upgradable to 7. The battery is smaller and lighter but lasts just as long, likely because of Android 6. The phone is much faster than the old one and more than adequate for most of us.  A6 allows more of apps to go to the SD card so 16G is lots for me, again better.  The phone on the phone works well too but most do, even for $20 bucks. The bad news; it's not bright enough in sunlight but I have never seen a phone that is.  The speaker could be louder and they could have used non skid on the back, besides being pretty, it's slippery but most use a case.  Read the instructions and completely cycle the battery at least 3 X before using and monthly after and you will have lots.  Did I say it was pretty? Must admit I will never understand why Nokia/MS couldn't attract the apps or sell the product.  I still take it with me if I expect to need to take some \"Camera Quality\" pictures.  How much can it cost to put a few turns of wire in the back for inductive charging?  Bottom line, a great phone at an incredible price; I don't know why anyone would need more. I even had it \"casting\" last nite until they figured out I was in Canada.  Bluetooth pairs quickly and solid even with old stuff.",

The dual SIM card thing is really convenient for international travel, and the expandable memory is great for saving movies for long flights. I might just keep using this one.  The only issues I have are that the camera isn't so great,but it works well enough in good light, and the volume on the speaker is a little low...But for $60 vs. my $600 phone, the value proposition is through the roof.  And I have found that some of the adverts are super useful for me, so I like having the ads.  Maybe that's weird.",

    "text": "I bought this phone because my iPhone digitizer went bad and I needed something ASAP, since I also use it for business. The reviews were decent and Amazon was selling it for a special price. I've had this phone for about 2 1/2 weeks. Here are the pros and cons I've experienced.Pros-1. I like the size and weight of the phone. It's light, without feeling cheap.2. Pretty easy to maneuver around being that it doesn't come with any manual, though the switch from iPhone to Android is a little trying.3. Takes great outdoor pictures, even better than my iPhone.4. I like the screen size and clarity.Cons-1. I don't like how far the camera lens sticks out, it makes me nervous it will get scratched up, and the case I bought for it is on backorder till mid September. :/2. Speaker is weak. So very weak. Wear earbuds or use Bluetooth for a wireless speaker.3. Takes forever to charge. Forever. And ever.4. **It randomly reboots itself, even in the middle of conversations. Is this normal? I don't know, but this bothers me the most. So far it hasn't happened while I'm on the phone with clients, but it has when I'm talking with friends, and leaves me a bit paranoid.5. BLU, while compatible with my AT&T; provider, is not recognized within their system and therefore could not have my contacts transferred. It's a bummer to start over.6. While texting the space bar is a bit fickle and will input random abbreviations, I encourage proofing before sending.Overall, it's not a bad phone. (I can get over the speaker inadequacies, and snail-like charging time- for now.) The price could not be beat, but I think the company has some improvements to make to make it really successful.",

    "text": "Not a big smartphone fan but picked up a refurb about a year ago. Surprised by the neat features: GPS- turn by turn navigation, note taking, book downloading and listening to audio books , music etc. Was NOT about to spend $700 on a phone but decided to spring for about $100 for a decent phone evaluated by some online tech sources I've trusted over the years.  Then came Amazon Prime day and the BLU R1 HD along with the Moto G 4th gen. I vascillated between the two but the deciding factor lay with just how intrusive the Amazon ads would be so I went lowball and got the BLU phone. I've had the phone a few weeks now and am very happy with the purchase. It has a sharp screen and is quite responsive. I also bought the $7 cover shield - YEAH , I've dropped it- just for added insurance.  The Amazon ads on the opening screen which I guess is called the \"lock screen\"  can simply be swiped off with your finger bringing you to the normal android experience. The Amazon apps are present and can be moved if you wish but as a Prime member I would have downloaded them anyway. All in all it has been a very good purchase and I don't think I would hesitate getting another Amazon phone with the limited ads.  The only reason I did not give a five star rating is that the phone will not take my 32 Gig SD card and make it part of the internal memory which the Android Marsmellow OS now makes possible. It is a class 10 U1 , the fastest I could find, but when trying to format it you are warned the card is too slow. This same issue has been brought up by others but I've managed to transfer some of the apps to the external SD and again not a big issue.  I've read some of the negative reviews about \" color scale\" etc. but I've never owned a \"Flagship\" phone so have nothing to compare it to. The colors are bright and crisp and it is much faster than my old refurb. All I can say is that for a $60 phone it has exceeded my expectations.",

The volume is low when trying to speak on the phone or play music directly from phone but when you hook it up to earphones, a radio, or bluetooth, the sound is crystal clear! The screen is so vivid and clear, it makes gaming or everyday use exciting! For someone whom is losing their sight, this is a GREAT phone to have. The picture is so clear that you almost forget that you have any vision problems! Then there's the internal memory. I have paired it with my 32gb micro SD card and after all the music, videos, pictures, movies and games I've downloaded, I haven't even touched my SD card! The slim design fits right into the palm of your hand. It's not too big or bulky or heavy. I was so worried about the size and weight that I bought a case to protect it (which I normally don't do with a phone, I just buy a new one) because I don't want it to break and I won't be able to order a new one or replacement! I have recommended this phone to family, friends and business partners and they have bought one also. I just wish that you can buy more than one at the special discount but, the overall price is not bad for what your getting.If I was to give it a rating after having it a little over a month, I would give it a 9/10. The only reason it wouldn't get the full 10 is because of the volume issue.",

My previous phone a DL750 cost me $6000 JMD and no where near this phone in specs, looks etc.I have it going into two weeks now and have not had any issues, wifi, bluetooth, installing sd card, apps everything has worked well so far.The phone looks good. At first glance persons are curious as to the type of phone and some even shock that it's a blu phone. So my $60 phone looks physically good as those other expensive phones :)Now again I can't truly complain about the phone for the price point.I wish though, the speaker could be a bit louder.Camera quality is good and I mean in good lighting etc and steady hands you get a decent pic. Front camera also surprisingly good.Movement and low light don't expect a glamour shot, be realisticUp to ten apps open and haven't experienced lag or slownessBattery life, now this is tricky... it seems to drain fast, however I make it through the day without charging. So a full charge at 7/8am by 10/11 pm it's around 30% or less. Whatsapp, fb, browsing, youtube *whispers* and PGo LOL. So when the phone reaches around 70% and lower it seems to drain slower than from 100%. So it's tricky. However again I do make it through the day without having to charge.Charging, within 2 hours you can get back to 100% from 50% or more.Note though, something I'm yet to find out. seem like headphones have to be special. I say this cause my standard earphones chips in and out, seem to not have the right rings or connection to match the port. so something to check on.All in all I am pleased with the phone so far.

I opted for this BLU R1 HD with ads and am pretty much blown away by it. It's surprisingly fast, has a perfectly serviceable screen, and supports microSD cards. I bought a 64 gig microSD card, and ended up with an 80 gig designated mp3/podcast player for 50 dollars less than I would have spent for a refurbished 16 gig iPod. Since I'm not using phone data, and have the option to turn off WiFi and bluetooth, the battery lasts me longer than my 9 month old Nexus 5X. I notice the lock screen ads, but they're hardly a dealbreaker.

    "text": "What an incredible buy. I originally wasn't planning to get this BLU phone as I already owned the BLU Life One X and was sufficiently satisfied with its performance, with a few caveats (which I provide in my review of that product). Unfortunately, after 6 months of use, the digitizer went on the fritz and I found myself needing another phone. Now that I've been babied by inexpensive but quality unlocked phones and unwilling to go back to paying AT&T; $20+ monthly for a phone that really only performs marginally better than these sub-$100 phones, I went with the communal option and bought the BLU R1 HD with the 2GB RAM upgrade (tl;dr: GET THE UPGRADE.)Wow, what an improvement, even over the Life One X! Even though the processor has 4 cores opposed to the X's 8, the upgrade to Android 6.0 makes this a really snappy phone with even better multitasking. I'm sure if the Life One X ever gets its Marshmallow upgrade, it'll be pretty fast too, but come on...a $60 phone this fast is ridiculous. I've already recommended it to all of my friends. Plays streaming video with zero lag, plays every game I like without any stuttering. The ads are a bit of a hassle, but worth it when the result is a reduced price. There's even the occasional good deal that I wouldn't have seen without the phone.It's a no-nonsense, no-frills phone that performs admirably as a smartphone. There's no annoying 3rd party software overlaying the Android so it's just about the purest version of Android as you can get. I really have zero complaints about this phone.",

    "text": "Great Value for money.  Please note, I did not receive anything for writing this review.  I am simply an Amazon fan who buys most things through Amazon and have always been pleased with the way they have my back even when the actual manufacturer won\u2019t honor their own warranty \u2013 but I digress.  I have owned and used a BLU Life One L120 since April 2014 but wanted an upgrade.  At the time it was a choice between the latest iPhone or the Life One, at $219.00 the BLU phone was an ideal choice.  When I saw that Amazon and BLU had partnered to bring the BLU R1 HD to the marketplace for $109.00 I was intrigued.  I read through the phonearena.com review of the R1 HD and decided to buy it based on three factors: 1) Metal Frame, 2) Gorilla Glass, 3) MediaTek MT6735 chipset. The MT6735 reportedly integrates a 1.7 Ghz quad-core Cortex A-53 CPU and a Mali-T760GPU.  This puts the processing power on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, a chip found in pricier phones.I purchased the BLU R1 HD, paid the extra money so that I don\u2019t have any ads on the lock screen or other places.  Final cost on Prime $109 some change.The phone comes with a handful of icons pre-installed on the screen.  The first being a Google icon which has grouped together the following apps:  Google, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Youtube, Drive, Music, Movies, Hangouts, Photos \u2013 the typical Google apps.The next icon is the BLU help app.The next is an Amazon icon grouping together the following apps: Amazon store, Amazon video, Kindle, Audible, Amazon Music, Amazon Drive, Amazon App store.The final icon was the Google play store.Underneath this row of icons / apps is the usual: phone, camera, messaging and browser (Opera by default).What I really liked was the ability to have Google and Amazon work together.  On my Kindle Fire, I cannot download the Google play store apps without some major work arounds which don\u2019t always works.On my other android devices I typically can\u2019t run Amazon Video.This device allows me to have it all together.  I typically use Amazon for my music, books and video and Google Play for apps that I struggle to find on the Amazon app store, such as apps to monitor Vitamin K levels in foods and other obscure apps I need.The phone is well built and seems pretty solid.  It is fast and I haven\u2019t had any buffering issues streaming video and audio.According to the phonearena.com review, BLU has guaranteed an update from the current OS Marshmallow to the next version of Android called Nougat.  I am somewhat skeptical as when I bought my Life One the site guaranteed update from Android Jelly Bean to Kit Kat, this never happened.  So while the Life One is a great phone and I have been using it daily, it is still Jelly Bean, can\u2019t upgrade to Kit Kat or Lollipop and Nougat is coming out soon.The R1 HD seems to have pretty good battery life doing mundane things such as reading books, or on standby.  Video and audio naturally use more battery but still the battery life seems pretty good to me.Sim card is a Micro Sim; I had a Nano Sim in my Life One inside of a standard Sim adapter.  I did not want to mess with buying a new Sim and so ordered the SimDevil 3 in one Sim adapter kit (on Amazon of course), inserted the Nano sim into the micro sim adapter, inserted into my phone and it worked without any issues.  Cricket wireless, my carrier automatically set the phone to the correct AT&T; settings and I was able to talk and text without having to make any further modifications.Memory card went in, reformatted and works smoothly too.My only issue with this phone is that the battery is not removable.  I typically prefer a removable battery so that I can buy a new one in a year\u2019s time and maintain good battery life for my phone.But at the price I paid for the phone I may simply upgrade to a new phone in a couple of years\u2019 time.",

I keep it in a case (I have butterfingers when it comes to phones), but it feels nice enough when not inside the case.It seems to be surviving the drops onto our tile floor just fine (Once again--in the case!)Recently I've noticed that the phone will NOT stay on silent mode. It doesn't matter if I choose the silent \"audio profile\" or one of the Do Not Disturb settings (I've tried the timed ones and the ongoing ones with no difference). The phone was not always this way, but I'm not real sure what I can do about it. It seems that once I receive a call, it knocks the silent mode off for the following calls/notifications. Compared to what I was dealing with as far as my old phone, I'd take non-silent over non-functioning any day.Also, having switched from a Samsung phone (Galaxy Alpha), I feel like the contacts and phone functions are very basic, and I think backwards from what I was used to (I'm still accidentally dismissing calls instead of answering them).The camera is okay, it suffices for my needs.I also found that the phone seemed to be keeping ALL the data from anything I'd ever done, and had to manually create storage by clearing app data within one month of use.The ads aren't too intrusive, not too different from what's on my kindle paperwhite.Overall, I find the phone is adequate for what I need.",

First off the ads on the home screen are not intrusive and in no way affect the usability of the phone. I saw the deal I bought the phone I love it. It has Android 6 .0 I don't believe it's getting 7 but for 60 bucks You're Still have up-to-date software. It's capable of doing everything and running any app you want. The camera quality is ok in general. The camera quality is great for $60. With the rise of prices on phones like the iPhone seven upwards $700. This phone is for your average user who doesn't mind not having a brand to pay for. Keep in mind ZTE is on the rise with its quality budget phones like the axon 7.

    "text": "I can't say enough good about this so far. Been using about 4 days, the \"ads\" are about 1/2\" high, and as wide as the screen and only there when you have to unlock the phone. Honestly, I am in the habit of ignoring them. They don't interfere with anything. Videos on this thing are AMAZING! The camera works flawlessly. And, the apps work so fast due to all the ram/memory. The only thing so far I dislike is the alarm clock defaults to PM, not AM, and that I'm not sure why it's not alarming and waking me up. It's a settings issue, I'm sure, but that's it. Battery seems to last a long time as well.VERY HAPPY!",

I was using iPhone 6 but wanted straight talk and couldn't afford the high price of the phone and stumbled upon this deal. Figured for the price worth a try. Works and looks great. The screen size is bigger than the iPhone 6. One reviewer said it was not 5\" and yes it is. IPhone 6 is 4.7 and Blu is definitely bigger. You can't go wrong for 60.00 with this one.Update: sadly I have to return. I really wanted to love it but after a few weeks I just can't deal with the unresponsive keypad. The phone looks great but is extremely painful to text or message. The keypad response is just horrible. Had this been different I would've gladly kept. The battery life btw was awesome. Best I've ever had. What a shame. Blu make a better keypad and this will be a winner. Back to iPhone I go...,",

Nor does it come with a support chat line or email address.  And even though it is sold through Amazon exclusively to it's Prime members does not have Amazon support.  So when, for example, the phone rings but the screen remains dark and there is to way to answer the call, or when the phone vibrates in your ear every time you make a call, there is no where to go to figure it out.  Yes, there is a FAQ page on the Blu website, but very broad answers that sometimes are kind of confusing.  There is a support phone number which I have yet to call but I dislike customer service phone numbers just based on previous experiences..",

I ordered the official case over a month ago for $6.99 I have been waiting patiently then they tried to ship it before I got paid and now the order got cancelled. Now the price has skyrocketed from $6.99 to $17.43, needless to say I will not be getting one anymoreBattery life is better than any other Android phone I've ever owned.More premium feeling than any other budget Android Smartphone I've ever owned. The chamfered edges really make it for me. Every phone I've owned before would get crumbs or lint stuck between the edge of the screen and the body of the phone. Trying to get it out with your finger nail or paper clip just makes it get even more stuck and that drives me crazy. Not a problem with this device.I will say that it works great with Pokemon Go.

    "text": "For the price this phone is awesome. I had a Samsung S5 which I thought was running a bit slow these days and thought at 60 dollars this was worth a try. I wasn't expecting much but it works great. It lacks a couple of things like there doesn't seem to be a compass on it. When using Google maps it doesn't show me which direction I'm pointing.The camera on it is OK but not really that great. Being realistically at this price what else could you expect. I thought the camera on my S5 was really bad. The battery life isn't too bad, I seem to get a day out of it, I'm mainly just using it for maps, texting and some internet browsing.When playing Pokemon Go the camera doesn't work when you're catching a Pokemon. Phone feels like its built really well. I never heard of Blu but I would totally buy one of these again, perfect if you're just using basic stuff on your phone and you're worried about damaging or losing a 600-700 dollar phone or don't want to fork out big money.",

    "text": "I bought this as a spare phone, as my Family Plan from Cricket is a 5-phone plan. I use it mainly as a Waze device while driving, and occasionally to hot-spot internet to my laptop at work. First, the phone was cheap and the ads don't bother me. It came from the box unlocked and rooted, so the hot spot worked without any tweaking. The phone does not have a lot of advanced features, but that is expected for a phone at that price. The speed is adequate, and it functions fine overall for my purpose. My major complaint is the auto-rotate feature, which doesn't work worth a damn. It is slow revolving the screen from landscape/portrait and back, and sometimes does erratically. When driving I have to keep it locked on portrait mode while mounted on the dash, as it will snap to landscape from simply rounding a curve and not return. I would recommend this for the purpose that I am using (spare phone) but definitely not as a day-to-day phone, just too frustrating dealing with the auto-rotate.",

    "text": "As the title suggests, you get what you pay for. Overall this is an okay phone, but for the price its you can't complain.There are three main issues I found with it...1. It is a very very quiet handset. The ringer turned all the way up and you can't easily hear it in your back pocket. You tube is almost unwatchable without earbuds. Phone conversations are now made via speaker phone. Now I know my hearing isn't the best, but I don't have this trouble with any of my old phones.Touchscreen is kind of so-so... There have been a few times where your touches aren't registered on the screen. Or there are such small icons that you can't accurately touch them.Camera is very Spartan.... All I can say about the cameras is, you have a couple. Megapixel wise they are a little below average, usefulness is none existent. I'm pretty sure I had a better camera on my old moto razor from way back when.Outside of these 3 issues it's a pretty decent phone for the money. If you are a shutter  bug, have average to large fingers or don't have bat like hearing this phone will only disappoint you.",

I also read the reviews about the sound being bad, the speaker not sounding good, and the camera being awful.  My experience, now a week in has been great! The sound quality on the phone is perfect. I have issues with lower frequencies and I can hear this without having to constantly adjust the volume. The speaker sounds loud and clear. Lastly, the camera is just as good as it was on the stylo. My pictures have been clear and some of the options are fun to play with. My kids especially love the picture in picture where it takes a picture with the front and rear cameras at the same time.  The OS is without a lot of the fluff that I had with LG with the exception of the Amazon apps. I knew this going into the phone and love using amazon prime so, for me, this was not an issue.  If you need a replacement phone or just a smartphone for everyday use, you can't go wrong with the $59.99 price.",

Calls come through clear (using consumer cellular/att network) and plenty of time to answer or reject calls. photos are great for the price point (its not going to take portrait quality snaps, but will suffice for catching the moment as it happens)It only received 4 stars, as it really does have little onboard storage with all the pre-loaded google/amazon apps. I so suggest spending the extra $10 or so for the bigger phone.

This phone works consistently and does everything I want and need. Would I get another, yeah and I won't have to finance to do it and will probably do it in less time than I would if I had one of the bigger brands. CAUTION: DO NOT EXPECT CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM BLU they are terrible but I hear they are improving so hopefully I'm wrong and my experience with them is in the past.

Resetting/re-configuring for the third time and some apps (Netflix & MoonReader to name a few) won't work anymore. Shortest span of any android I've used (for non-gaming basics like email, reading, streaming, browsing, etc).

The updated os, the smooth glass screen, all pluses. Even the bloatware doesn't really bother me, very convenient for Prime. I just wish the battery life would hold up. It's depressing that the map driving from the bay area to Tahoe ate the battery (died before I cleared the mountains, 'sad face). I was irritated enough that I almost mailed it back the first weekend. But the bottom line is that at this price, I can use this phone as a media player, or to automate the lights/windows/roku etc. - I'm going back to a larger screen (spoiled by 6\" previous cell size) eventually, but can shop and research until then.",

    "text": "In the past, I'd spend $500+ on each new phone I got, starting all the way back with my iPhone 3G. Had an iphone 4 which I loved, then made the excellent decision to switch to android with the note 2. After realizing the ridiculous amounts of money I was spending on phone service and phones, I'd come to the conclusion that cell phones weren't for me. Until one day, I came across a phone company called BLU, which exclusively sold well priced unlocked phones.Having always been interested in the next best thing, I was a bit skeptical at first, but was won over when I switched to T-Mobile and BLU, and saw my phone bill cut in less than half of what I was paying at AT&T;, for arguably better service (in my area). I tried out a few different BLU phones, and used a ZenFone 2 for awhile. While they were all fairly nice, and excellent for the price, they did seem to have one thing in common that I missed with my expensive phones, and that is they weren't as fast. While it never really bothered me, I could always tell the difference when using a friends galaxy S6 edge, for example.When I saw this phone listed at $60, I looked at the specs and was, as always, skeptical. I figured for so cheap though, why not have a back up phone? WRONG. This phone, though having near identical specs to my last few phones, is fast. I'm talking home button -> new app in .79 seconds fast. While realistically no, I didn't run any actual tests, this thing is incredibly smooth and has thus far handled everything I've thrown at it with 0 stuttering at all. Honestly, I am in amaze at how great this super affordable phone is. I couldn't ask for anything more in a phone.Beyond speed, the battery life is pretty great easily getting me through a normal day with usually more than 50% left, the screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight, as well as dims enough to comfortably use in the dark. It also looks and feels like I spent a bit more than $60 on it too, which is still blowing my mind. Amazon and BLU, you rock. 10/10 would buy again.",

(Unlike my LG4, which is dead after that long and *must* have a power brick attached for serious PoGo sessions.)It will play just fine without a SIM card as long as you have a wifi signal nearby (such as a friend running a hotspot on their phone). We bought one for our son specifically for this purpose and it works great.If you're going to get a screen protector for it, I recommend the matte finish. It doesn't *completely* cover the face of the phone, but it's close enough, and really cuts out the glare. Feels a little funny under your finger at first, but you get used to it quickly.",

Do a search in the reviews for \"freedompop\" and follow the instructions for getting it running.  The review was posted by Randall M and is great directions.  The only thing I will add is that when the freedompop messaging application is downloaded from the google play store it is outdated and it DOES NOT WORK until you update that application from freedompop.  Once that is done it works perfectly.  Follow this link to the Review for specific walkthrough on setup for Freedompop.

    "text": "Upgrading from a LG90 D415 several years old. Not a heavy smartphone user but wanted a phone that could 'hang with the big boys' and take decent video and pictures on and even play some of the neat drag racing games on when bored. I use T moble with no contract with them on their 2g/2g/2g per line data with unlimited talk/text for 3 lines for 90 bucks for myself and my wife and daughter. Since we're connected to wifi 99% of the time its no biggie. On to the phone. Got here in 2 days as expected, opened it up it wasn't cheaply made, screen was slightly curved it seems, no physical buttons other than the volume up/down and the power button on the right side. Home/back etc is all on screen. The phone doesn't have a very large selection of ring tones or features to customize the way you receive your calls or texts. I had my old LG set up to have a heartbeat style vibration for incoming calls and a double tap buzz for messages and I never once had it on anything but vibrate. This one its just standard vibrate or loud as all hell ring. It does have some variation in that you can set up different activities you can choose to be doing such as outside, meeting, at home etc like profiles but thats a bunch of nonsense who's got time for that. Lets get to the GUD stuff!VIdeos it plays perfectly, amazon streaming HD, netflix HD flawless over LTE and my wifi(which is 300Mbs) on LTE it pulled 66Mbs on speedtest.net and 108Mbs on wifi on speedtest. I ran a couple of benchmarks on the phone where as my LG90 D415 scored around 12k this one scored 29,000. I stress tested it running heavy intensive graphical apps for 24 hours straight and the phone did not over heat and i was able to still flip through pages on flipboard and scroll news on faux news and usa todays app without troubleIts got a quad(4 core) 1.6ghz processor in it and if you get the top model for 60 bucks it comes with i think 3 gigs of ram and 16 gigs of internal memory. It can take a 64gb micro SD card at least, probably a 128. Dual sims so you can run one for your carrier and another for international. The phone is well built, they already pushed out a new software update upgrading it to 6.5. Android 7.0 is coming to it in a month or so as well. 5\" display, gorilla glass 3.0 display. All for 50 bucks - does everything as well as the S6 did but at 1/10th the price, and its unlocked and you can use it on any carrier, no contract!",

When this popped up on my Prime, it seemed too good to be true.  It is a really great phone, does everything I need it to and more.  Camera is awesome.  Web, txt, etc.  biggish screen for my old eyes and fat fingers.  Price can't be beat!!!  But even auto-setting itshut down for six or seven hours nightly, I'm only barely getting 24hrs battery life, and it recharges very slowly with the provided charger, whether AC or car + inverter! and even worse with a USB car charger.  I'm off grid, so while I check in to places to charge from regular power periodically, this is an issue.  EVERYTHING else about this is five stars, but the battery life truly sucks.  And yes, I run it all the way down and charge to full, etc.  just has been ver,very sparse since day 1.  I'm using AT&T; go-phone with HUGE, simple success...  And love that when I'm moved I can change to the provider in that area.  Just neeeeed battery life.**Updating at 4 mos of use.  I am VERY careful with this, and do not carry it in a pocket or purse, it only goes in the padded laptop case.  The phone itself has bent around the power button--I really was having trouble getting it to come awake, (not to mention power on) and thought it was the thin case I was using... took the case off, and the phone itself it bent.  I have an ORIGINAL iPad that I bought used in 2010, with barely any scratches or nicks on it--I take care of my electronics.  I'm using this primarily as a hot-spot--so...  this isn't from abuse or dropping... I can't explain.The actual PHONE app hasn't upated at all since i got the phone as it tells me I don't have an SD card.  It keeps telling me I need to update it, it downlowds, then won't update.  i'm pretty sure those are security updates. <shrugs>  I don't need need an SD card (that I know of...) phone does what I need to, why should I need to purchase something to update it?  That seems scammy to me.  So... Not sure HOW I feel about it now.  I don't hate it--it does the hotspot job just fine, I'm happy with my AT&T; deal..  but *phone* wise...  :-/  I dunno  Will try to get a photo of the bent part.",

I am not one to track with the latest and greatest I am looking for a fully functional phone for the greatest bargain.  That is why I chose the Galaxy over an Iphone and at that a couple generations behind.Incredibly easy to setup.  Put in my SIM card and turned it on; went through the Google setup for email and etc. and in about 5 minutes I was up and running making calls.  I spent another 20 minutes adjusting setting from defaults to my preferences and am golden.  The phone is fast enough to handle anything I do on my phone (music, calls, texting and surfing, pictures and video).  Same form factor as my galaxy and just as easy to use if you are used to android.If you are an amazon member, use an android and have either T-Mobile or AT&T; and are looking for a fully functional phone and don't care about the cache of vendor who made your phone the color or whether it is metal or plastic this is a no brainer.  We all put cases on these phones anyway so the color, prominent name material the phone is made with is sort of irrelevant.  Does it match and Iphone 7 or a Samsung Galaxy 7, probably not but consider it costs 50 bucks compared to $700.

I'm a heavy Fire tablet user so it's my \"normal\" to have to flip past an ad to get to what I'm doing. There's an on-screen ad that can't be removed, too. I put it on the \"third page\" of app shortcuts so I don't have to look at it.The camera does well for casual use. It has a flash, zoom up to 4x, takes decent pics indoors and out, and the flash on the selfie cam is a nice bonus, if you're into that sort of thing.My biggest pet peeve with it (and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of five) is the speaker is on the back of the phone, which means if you've got the phone laying screen-up, you can't hear *anything*. If you're using the thing to listen to music, it *has* to be placed screen-down. Not the greatest when I'm trying to change Pandora stations or flip to the next podcast episode while washing the dishes.Pokemon Go players: The phone has *no* gyroscope. You can PoGo, but there's no AR mode. It's not a dealbreaker for me, my last phone didn't have one either.All in all I'm happy with the purchase. Just need to find a good bluetooth speaker for my kitchen, I guess.",

    "text": "This phone is amazing compared to a Windows 520 phone, but has problems that worry me. One gripe is the speakers.  The volume is lower than I would like at max volume.  The sound quality isn't the greatest. I sometimes compensate by running a cable from the headphone jack to external speakers on my clock radio and that helps.  I have had other budget phones but they were always hampered with not having enough memory.  I have learned that lesson.  I bought a micro card to add to supplement memory, although sometimes the phone seems reluctant to accept the card.  The screen is OK and the processor very fast.  I use the phone just at home on my bedside nightstand and on home WIFI.A major problem for me is the phone drains power even when off, just as if on.  I can have it fully charged and then turned off completely...eight hours later the battery is completely drained.  I have done all I can think of by turning off things except for the home WIFI access.  It still does this.  It is as if the phone can not be really turned off and somehow it is being used when I am not using it.  Every other phone I have ever had does not drain power when it is turned off.",

I got this phone to replace my 3rd gen moto g after it's charge port stopped working. It's easy to forget how cheap this phone is because of it's display and metal sides. Camera also isn't bad. (Not great but your snapchats and instagrams will be fine) The only problems I've had with the phone is that apps like snapchat will freeze every now and again but after a few seconds get rolling along and sometimes apps will disappear from the home screen and I'll have to put them back up. Also sometime the clock freezes and the only way to get it back on track is to reset it. (Hopefully a simple update will fix that) but if you can deal with a little quirkiness the phone is probably the best bang for buck phone you're going to get. 3 years ago this would have been a respectable flagship phone and now it feels like a reasonable midrange phone for a dirt cheap price.",

So, two weeks in, and I am still impressed with the build quality of this phone. It still feels great in the hand with the aluminum edging.After the 2 weeks of usage, I am even more impressed with the phone. I have experience no funny lags when switching between applications, or when scrolling webpages or applications like Newsstand. Even Google Maps and navigation run great. Battery life last me a day easy with my usage. I typically end with over 50% left at the end of the day. As my daily driver, it functions just fine for everything I do.One of the shortcoming of the phone was lack of NFC, which meant lack of ability to install Android Pay, which I had come to depend on for my loyalty cards like Lowes, Qdoba, Best Buy, AutoZone and CVS. I found Stocard, an app that allowed me to store all the cards into it solving my lack of Android Pay. One other feature I have missed is the wireless charging I had with the Nexus 6. Plugging it in is a step backwards, but it is no deal breaker by any means.Another difference I notice is the screen colors. Coming from the Nexus 6, I notice the green is not nearly as vivid on the R1 HD. It isn't that the colors are bad, it is just majorly tuned different and it has been a noticeable change. The screen works well with its auto brightness as I have used it outside and was able to use the phone without issue.At this point I am still missing the VoLTE and Band 12 support. The BLU website still shows the update will come shortly after the phone is released. In addition, I will also miss WiFi Calling that the BLU R1 HD lacks for when I travel to the boonies to my parents where no cell carrier has clean coverage.I was able to successfully use the camera for a mobile check deposit. Have only taken one photo of my pet, so not much to go on there, but the camera functioned fine and the picture captured what I wanted, so it can at least cover the basics. It is obviously not going to stand up next to the current top phones, but it gets the job done for a fraction of the cost.After 2 weeks with this phone, I can now say I will be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future as it covers all my needs at this time, or will when the Band 12 update arrives.",

I have experienced some lag running some apps, but I recently factory reset the phone and this issue seems to be much better.  The issue might not even be with the phone to begin with.  Sometimes it is a little slower than I expect from the excellent hardware specs, but then I remember the price and also take into account that I really haven't gotten rid of any of the bloatware.  Another serious plus is that you can totally root, bootloader unlock and debloat this sucker if you want to without much effort.  The volume is great in my headphones, turning up loud enough to actually probably be bad for my hearing which is much better than previous Samsung tablets and phones that I have owned.  Camera is more than adequate for my expectations from a cell phone, especially at this price point.  Memory is phenomenal.  Slap an SD in this thing and you will never run out. Design is sweet, I don't even want to put it in a case because I just really like the look of the phone, and at this price, that is almost an acceptable risk.  If you are like me and just love having a nice phone at a great price, than this is definitely the phone for you.  I owned the Blu 5.0 something or other and broke the screen while in my pocket 30 days in.  Granted, I didn't have it in a case at the time, so my bad, but the Gorilla glass on this thing is a huge plus as well.  I've had the phone for a couple of months now, carrying it in my pocket most of the time with just a case (I still haven't put the screen protector on it) and after I give it a quick wipe down, there still isn't even a scratch on the screen.  That's pretty impressive considering I take the thing to the beach and carry other non phone compatible things in my pockets.  If I could ask for one thing, which seems kind of whiny at this price point, it would be for a better speaker.  But if that's all I have to complain about after a couple of months use at $60.00, then five stars.",

    "text": "Never understood why Android phones seem to get better the cheaper they are. Cheaper phones seem to have more features, and better battery lives. I guess they're not designed as a fashion symbol.The R1 HD is not bad. I miss the dedicated function keys and removable battery of the $30 Android phone it replaces, but the screen is gorgeous, the dual SIM feature looks useful, and the processor and memory are a huge advance.My caveats that prevent me from giving this the full five stars:For the hardware/software:1. The battery is not removable, making this a disposable phone you'll have to throw away after a year or two.2. No dedicated home/list/back function keys, these share the screen and often need a swipe to bring up. It's fiddly and awkward, and not a sensible compromise with aesthetics.For the way Amazon is selling this phone:1. Amazon has a \"One per account\" policy for this phone. If you want one for your SO (as I did), you'll find the workarounds infuriating and needlessly bureaucratic.2. Because Amazon (quite reasonably) doesn't want people removing the ads, the phone is locked down more than usual, making custom ROMs more of a problem.You'll note I don't criticize the ads themselves. They're fine! They appear on the lock screen and you don't need to take any action if you don't want to buy whatever Amazon are selling.The pre-installed apps are just the usual Amazon suite: many of them are awkward to install on an ordinary phone, so it's actually nice to have, for example, Amazon Video set up already. Outside of those apps, it's pretty much stock Android.Battery life is... OK. I'm left with about 25-30% on the battery at the end of each day. Of course, it needs to be OK, as you can't switch to a backup.Cameras are decent. Not perfect, but better than  you'd expect at this price, and perfectly adequate for normal cameraphone things.In general, it's a very impressive phone, and I recommend it.",

    "text": "My prior phone was iPhone 5S about three years old off contract and dying.  Just cannot afford $650-$850 for a new phone. Meanwhile I did not want to spend $200 on a phone that did not make me happy.Enter BLU. And Amazon.  Fifty nine dollars - really?  Supported by about five years of great experience with Amaxon I took a leap of faith and ordered a phone site unseen. At this price I had little to lose.  Even if it breaks in a year I'm to the good as my three year old iPhone cost $200 a year ($600/3). I got the 16gb 2gig memory version.First of all the elephant in the room.  So far Amazon adds on the lock screen are not at all intrusive. And I'm a person very sensitive to being marketed at. Nine out of ten times I have a notification so they (thankfully) minimize the add to share space.  It's a bit startling when you do get a full screen add just cause your not expecting it; however those I've seen so far were trailered to the phone such that they blended edge to edge and did not block the time or battery indicator, etc.Moving to Android from apple not to hard.  Phone uses a micro not nano SIM card but a quick trip to AT&T; had me up and running.Screen is great - really.  Typing is easy as screen is responsive and accurate.  Phone works (speaker phone is not loud but I rarely use it). Over all it is faster and snappier than my iPhone or wife's Galaxy 5 (2 years old).  And the bigger screen over iPhone 5 is much appreciated.  Camera is just OK. Battery life seems midrange but doable as battery won't make it a whole day of medium to heavy use in my short experience to date.  So far no pauses or glitches or hiccups.  If you handed the phone to a stranger they would assume it's a Samsung Galaxy.As long as Amazon does not change how they use their add space in the futer I'm a customer for life at this price.",

Screen display is awesome and phone looks sleek and neat. Amazon apps are great since I use Amazon a lot for my shopping it's convenient for me. The price at which this phone is available on Amazon it's unparallel to other. The reason I gave 4 star is, sound clarity is not that great also there is a defect in the SMS app. one can't delete the message while in the message. My microSD got corrupted with in two weeks, not  sure whether it's a phone issue since I had same microSD in my old phone, I will test with new microSD.

Go to settings->about device->update and check for updates BEFORE you use the phone.  You have to enter an amazon account to get to that point, so you should probably enter a bogus one until the phone is updated.Great looking screen, and nice feel to the phone.

Call quality is clear and loud, the phone feels sturdy and well made, the speaker phone is loud and the touch screen is responsive.  The camera is not great - I would say that the pictures on this are less clear than that of my old S3.  Not much else I can say, really.  It's rather solid all around.The Amazon ads aren't as bad as you'd think.  The biggest problem is that you need to swipe them off before you can get to your password screen, so it adds a step.  Unfortunately for Amazon, this makes it even easier to ignore the ads since I can just do an upward swipe on the phone before even looking at the screen to enter my password.  Perhaps they will change this in the next s/w revision.",

No shovelware to delete.Good clean recovery with backup/restore to sdcard options.Marshmallow has a feature where it can directly mount (\"adopt\") the microSD card onto the system.

If I had to compare it to a phone on the market, it would be the Alcatel One Touch Fierce XL.The screen has excellent HD quality. I don't think I would ever go back to a screen without it. It is a 5\" screen which is perfect for those of us that have fat fingers or those of us that need a bigger viewing area.The size of the phone itself is perfect. Not to big, not to small. It's thin, sleek slender design is perfect for quick stash pocket, purse etc... on the go with out being bulky or heavy but big enough to find in a Mary Poppins Purse!I love the clarity of my games, the ease of downloads and the options and features it has allowing you to control what's stored internally and externally. Phone storage isn't clogged with applications that you don't use or that are unnecessary.Now, my only Concern is that the volume is quite low even at it's highest setting. I am partially deaf so it's hard to hear but even others that I have let use the phone say but that it's not just me, the volume is low. Buying a Bluetooth to fix that issue. Volume though is louder and crystal clear with headphones.I had no problems putting in my SIM card, and SD card. Calling the phone into Metro PCS was a breeze! Set up quick and efficiently which is a huge plus because I do a lot of business and school work from my phone.Would I recommend this phone to a friend or a family member? YES! As a matter of fact, my boss, (whom is an EXTREMELY critical person) ordered one & got hers in the mail after I received mine because she saw all the wonderful things this phone does and how easy it was to use especially since she is disabled.Great job BLU and Amazon for providing us with such a great product.",

Speed is fast and can run multiple apps with ease. Very easy to set up and has a beautiful screen. The ads are no problem just on the lock screen so at least you have something to look at when unlocking the phone and have had no effect on data usage. Really for 60 bucks you would be crazy to pass this phone up. Do wish the battery was a little better but it will last a day so not a big deal. Speaker sound is good call quality is great. If 60 bucks is too much to spend get the 8 GB version for 50 bucks and put in a memory card and set it to internal storage.",

Haven't seen a hiccup yet.I played some Amazon Prime and Youtube 720p videos on this and they look good. The display itself is bright enough for my satisfaction, and the color saturation seems minimal.Wifi connection is good, but no 5GHz. Bluetooth and GPS work excellent.  Did not get to test with my sim card yet.The speaker audio is pure crap, it's laughable. The headphone audio is loud and crisp.The camera takes decent photos front and back, way better than I expected. And not too bad in low light, but nothing compared to today's flagship phones.The micro USB slot is pretty tight, hope that doesn't cause breakage down the line.Battery life seems like it can go a day with normal usage.So far the only thing about this phone that is horrible is the speaker. It's the worst speaker I've ever experienced on a phone, EVER!!!!But other than the speaker, this phone is worth every dime. More than meets my expectations.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE ....... as a backup, gift, or if you don't need what flagship phones have to offer.As far as the Amazon ads go .......The full screen ads on the lock screen are not bad at all. And it only does full screen if you have no notifications shown, otherwise it will show your notifications over normal wallpaper and a small ad under the notifications. Amazon did a great job at not being intrusive.  But regardless I'm still hoping for root and custom rom on this phone.",

BUT if you have Metro PCS, be aware that you have to get a special plan if you are using an unlocked phone. The rep was able to reduce the price of the plan to bring it in line with what I was paying before, but I get only 1GB 4GLTE per month now for the same price. You cannot use the automated system to set this up yet, you need to call. The rep I talked to was very helpful, but it took me about 2 hours from opening the box to getting the phone set up on their network. Do yourself a favor and just call Metro PCS when you're ready to activate instead of fumbling through it and discovering that you have to call anyway.UPDATE: If you are having trouble with apps crashing as soon as they open (like Starbucks) the system update from 7/16/16 fixes these. Everything's working perfectly now.UPDATE 2: I love the phone overall, but it's getting really irritating that I get a notification every time a new ad is available on the lock screen. It sounds the same as all the other notifications, so I have to check every single time to make sure it's not a text or other message. I NEED some way to turn notification sounds off just for new ads. Minus one star, unless someone can tell me how to turn off the sounds for just the ads.UPDATE 3: The lock screen ad notification is finally taken care of.

I do still love my phone but it looks like they don't last very long at all. 4 month isn't long enough for a phone to have issues. I do all of the updates it seems to get worst after each update.... Kinda reminds me of a iPhone but it's a nice phone still just crashes on apps and turns off",

However, this phone is even more frustrating then my Windows phone.  Constantly rebooting, rings, doesn't ring, very slow at times.  Put anything on the SD card then the settings will no longer give you information about the phones internal storage, just sits there and spins.  Let it sit on this for an hour, no change.  Also, the camera is not very good.  This is saying something when I think my Windows Nokia 640 has a better camera.  I think maybe the processor with the phone is just under powered.  As, a phone (besides the issue with ringing/not ringing) and for simple games, the phone works fine.  Also, don't use the SD card.  Go beyond that, well maybe I expected too much from a budget phone.  Finally, I gave up and am returning it.  Amazon, makes it very easy to return when things don't work out.  Thanks Amazon.",

Then I find out that I was putting in my nano sim card from my fire phone that's why it would not read my sim card. I decided to get a new sim card (Micro) from my carrier (AT&T;/PureTalk) and bought this BLU R1 HD phone Without Ads for $50 more. So far, the phone is working great, it read my new micro sim card right away. The android system and the phone itself is really fast. I am comparing this to my fire phone (which I still love). This phone is lighter than the fire phone and the screen is bigger than the fire phone and so much faster than the fire phone. The camera is great too. I love that all the basic google apps are already downloaded, I'ma big google user (I have a chromebook!). I also love that the basic amazon apps are already downloaded too! The best part is that there are NO ADS, the one with the ads got annoying!",

The amazon ads are barely or even not annoying. I had $200 DLS smartphones and they do not have the state of the art picture options this phone has. Dual SIM card phones normally ranges between 150 to 280 DLS and you have that option in a $50 phone called Blu. I made my first HD video call on the T-Mobile VoLTe network, it was fantastic! Oh by the way most HD phones cost more than 100 bucks and my BLU R1 HD smartphones cost me only half. Certainly, I will continue buying BLU PRODUCTS",

You get Marshmallow straight out of the box and it is a very close to vanilla android experience with minimal to no bloatware - aside from the Amazon apps that is. My wife drowned her last phone when we went to the beach and I gave her mine's so I needed a quick replacement and this one will be my daily driver for a while now. Keep up the good work Blu and Amazon!",

Except for the Amazon stuff it is almost stock Android 6. Navigating through the phone is smooth and no lag. Watching videos looks good for a 720p display. It will never compete with a SD but it costs 1/10 the price. The cameras are garbage but usable and I think the auto brightness is a bit too dark in a well lit room. But 60 bucks for a burner phone, a kids phone, or a backup phone. That's great. The Amazon adds aren't overly annoying and are just on the lock screen. I you have a notification on the lock screen you won't see the ad",

Startup and setup was a bit tedious, especially without adequate written instructions showing where in the process you are.  Took a long time for the phone to accept settings, get itself set up and be capable of dialing a number.  Prior to this lengthly setup, you can only make emergency calls.  I don't think you can even setup the phone without a functioning wi-fi connection.  That's the way it seemed to me anyway.

Unless there's a software setting or app. I'm unaware of this is a big problem. T-Mobile has terrible service inside my house and without wi-fi calling I can neither send or receive messages or calls in my house.  This is a huge issue, as I may not have purchased this phone had I known this feature was missing.2) Bluetooth does not connect to more than one device- right now a Logitech mobile boom box. I'd like it to play through a Vizio sound bar as well.3) Battery- Takes an inordinately long time to charge, plus after a full night of charging it only goes up to 90-92%.  If I disconnect the charger and use the phone for a few minutes, then plug it back, it goes to 100%. Weird.4) Poor speaker, but not much worse than my previous LG5) Apparently no compass sensor.

Google Play and all the other apps works perfectly fine. But.... The front camera sucks and won't take good pictures in the dark. Snap chat app sucks with this phone. And this phone takes a long time to charge. The volume on the phone when watching videos and music is not loud enough for me. I've seen other phones with a higher volume.  And I am unable to choose my song for my ringtones :( Other than that,  five stars!!",

It is less user friendly because it does have a different layout compare to other popular brand; you might need some exploring before you get used to this phone.The only two things I don't like about this phone are the build-in alarm app and the screen.  Maybe I am still not understand how the alarm works? (Lol, which is either I am pathetic or the alarm is not working properly)  Sometimes the alarm will go off a few minutes after it is set to go off (in fact, it didn't went off at all a few times).  So I just downloaded a different alarm app, no biggie.  The screen is quite easily scratched though.  My phone's screen had a big scratched even before my screen protector is delivered.  I always carry my phone extremely careful.  I had Samsung S5 for almost 3 years and there is not even a scratch on the phone and I don't even have a case for it.  Maybe I was just careless with this phone, but that is just my opinion.But overall this phone is doing its job!  Can't complain too much!",

    "text": "This is an absolutely superb phone and an incredible value.I dropped my iPhone 6 Plus and got this as a temporary replacement for my iPhone, but now I'm considering switching to Android.This phone compares very well to the $800 iPhone 6 Plus.  My estimates are as follows:- Processor speed: 80% as fast- Battery life: lasts 90% as long- Screen quality: 95% as crisp.- Camera quality: 90% as sharp.  - Camera speed is noticably slower when the flash is in use.- Touch screen quality; 100% as precise.- Durability and ability to withstand drops:  Superior.- There is no compass in this phone, so using Google Maps to navigate is a bit different because the map doesn't automatically re-orient when you turn the phone.  Turn by turn driving navigation works fine though (but I wish it had a compass).This is a very solid phone and I will be buying a new one of these Amazon lock screen ad phones whenever they are released.  It is such an incredible triumph to release a phone of this quality for such a low price.  The incredible value of this phone makes me seriously reconsider paying so much for an iPhone.",

The ads are only on the lock screen and don't bother him at all. The phone is better than the one he had before and he loves it. I wish there was more of a selection of cases for it , but that's the only drawback I can see.There is a website that has all the drive providers APN Info to setup the network if you have too. We put ATT SIM card in it and it automatically found the network settings. I think most carriers will work without setting up, but it's very easy if needed.The phone also has dual sim slots which is cool. We put two SIM cards in to see if they would work together , and they do! It even ask what sim to use when calling out making it possible to use two phone numbers on one phone. Would be handy for business/personal customers.Camera isn't the greatest , but it works. It does have a front racing flash which is awesome for the ones who love to take selfies.All and all we Are very pleased with this phone. and for the money it's a no brainier !!!! I recommend !",

Not as good of battery life as I had hoped for under heavy use.2. Camera is low quality, and has trouble focusing when taking moving shots3.

Can't beat the price for a phone like this and, in my case, uses tracfone data and phone number from my old phone with no hassles!  Pretty good, BUT, some problems are: the phone will NOT link to your Windows 10 OS computer!  You will NOt be able to download your pictures to your os10 computer or link to it by usb!  It will link to Amazon Music in theory via WIFI, but I have had problems with that.  It did download my purchased file from Amazon AFTER I downloaded a music app from the Google store and that plays well!  Also, you will NOT be able to download your pics to OS10 in any way I've been able to find!  The problem seems to be there is no driver that the OS10 will recognize for this device and the Phone Mfg. says Microsoft has to provide it and that hasn't happened yet.  I've been told that windows 7 OS computers will link via usb, but I have not verified that.  Works better than my old phone but even that old junk linked to my computer, so, what gives!",

    "text": "Spoiler alert\u2026 this phone is amazing for it\u2019s price tag (I paid $60 for the 2gb RAM/16gb ROM version).  This is the 3rd Blu phone that I\u2019ve owned, and while it\u2019s not the best Blu phone I\u2019ve owned, this is a remarkable deal considering the package that you receive for price.  Here are my thoughts on all the important aspects of any mobile phone:Performance: 4.5/5 - This is not the snappiest phone you can find, but it also isn\u2019t a laggy phone either (I\u2019ve had plenty of those).  The Mediatek quad-core processor in this phone is very respectable.  I am able to have plenty of apps running in the background and still play games like Madden Mobile and NBA Jam with very little to no noticeable lag.Cameras: 4/5 - The rear camera is 8mp, while the front camera is 5mp. There is a single LED flash on both the front and the back of the phone for low light situations.  The rear camera is a solid performer in good lighting conditions.  In fact, it takes great photos in good lighting, but where this camera suffers is in less than perfect lighting conditions.  The pictures aren\u2019t bad in low light, but they are grainy and lack detail (which is common for most phones, especially in the budget category).  The front facing selfie camera takes pretty decent pictures as well.  You won\u2019t be wowed by the quality, but you also won\u2019t be embarrassed with your selfie game when using this phone.Display: 4.5/5 - This is only a 720p HD IPS display (compared to 1440p screens on flagship phones), but this display looks good in my opinion.  You would have to really be looking closely to notice any pixelation.  I have a S7 Edge with a 1440p screen (probably the best one you can get), and it looks better, but I think the Blu R1 HD has a very pleasing screen to look at.  It gets bright, and looks good.Build Quality: 3.5/5 - The build is decent.  My only complaint is how slippery the back plastic plate is.  I wish Blu would have added some sort of texture to it, so instead you should consider buying a case to protect your phone and give it some grip.  The edges of the phone are surrounded by a metal frame that gives it a nice solid feel in the hand.  This phone for me is very usable with one hand thanks to the smaller screen (5\u201d), and thin build.Battery Life: 4.5/5 - This phone is powered by a 2500 mAh battery, which so far is giving me around 4 hours of screen on time.  I am a power user, so 4 hours of screen on time doesn\u2019t quite get me through a day, but for most users 4 hours of screen on time will pretty easily get them through a normal day.  This phone does not have any sort of quick charging, so if you are used to that, this will feel like it charges at a snails pace, but in my Ampere test it charges around an average of 700 mA.Android Build: 5/5 - This phone is basically running stock 6.0 Marshmallow, which is to say that it is very clean without a bunch of unneeded features or apps.  The only \u201cbloat\u201d is the Amazon apps that come pre-loaded on the phone.Call Quality and signal strength: 4/5 - Previous Blu phones that I\u2019ve owned suffered from slightly less signal quality versus other phones I have at the same locations.  The same is true of this phone, but to a lesser extent.  If you live in a location with poor signal this probably won\u2019t help that situation, but since I live in a location with great signal this isn\u2019t issue for me at all.  The signal isn\u2019t bad, just not as good as it is with my Moto G4 Plus, Nexus 6p or my S7 Edge.Other Notes:- The Amazon lockscreen ads are very unobtrusive.- No NFC- The speaker on the back is not great, so no dance parties will be had.  It works just fine, but the quality is lacking.- Blu doesn\u2019t include the case or screen protector with this phone (like they normally do).Conclusion: This phone isn\u2019t perfect, but for $60 it is amazing.  Easily worth that price with all that it does well.",

Can anyone tell me where you can get a phone like this for the price this sells for...yea...thought not.Most recent review from a user that paid a whole $10 a month for his phone...and the phone is now acting up...hello?  Maybe you should buy a new one.  Know anywhere else you can get such a phone so cheap?  Totally clueless.  It's a phone that sells for $60...it won't last forever.  If it lasts six months to a year...you got a steal.Just gets better everyday...Amazon really hit it out of the ballpark with this phone...Even if it were to last only two months...you still got a deal.  Everything is working as it should...this could change the whole industry.  Why pay $800 for phone when you can pay $60?Access to Google Play...ding...ding...we have a winner here.I have had a $800 G7 for two years, been a great phone but now have charging issues and looking to replace.  Not interested in adding another line to get another phone and pay another $900 that's where this new phone came into play.This new phone seems to be right up there, is loud, plays awesom video, clear calls, music plays well, internet surfing is fast, blue tooth pairing works well.2nd day still working like a charm.Day three...gets better everyday.  Listen to music everyday...does a great job.Too many people stretch the truth or use flat outright lies on here.  I have dropped the phone and has not shattered yet.  There is no lague...playing games maybe yes...but come on.Day 5 or 6...this phone does everything my $800 Galaxy does for  1/8 the price.  Just a great phone that will change the market...you would have to be pretty dumb to pay extra.  The ads are seldom there.I am not a Amazon goon...I ordered the phone protector and screen protector.. they were to be here today (Sat May 27) but now maybe Tue or Wednesday.  They got an ear full...most likely nothing will happen but the time is coming...it's ontime or it's free.Back on subject this is a great phone for cruising the internet, listening to music, making phone calls, reading email...yet to use it as a hot spot to share it's internet sharing capabilty.  Amazon please remove the fake reviews.  I know they are fake cause I know this phone.This phone will simply crush the compition, all of it.Day 7, still working fine.3rd week and the phone just gets better and better, no lague, no dimming of display, phone takes a beating.To quote Lee Iacoco, \"If you find a better phone at a better price, buy it.\"  You won't.",

    "text": "Let me start with the fact that I didn't buy this phone for my self. I have a Galaxy S8. My mother in law needed a new phone. I've been eyeing this phone since it released and I knew people got this phone to play Pokemon Go so it was at least decent at that.After setting it up, I played around with the phone while waiting for the MIL to come pick it up. I gotta say, for $60, this is an amazing phone! The build is very solid. I love the design and the bars around the frame (might be cheap but it looks great!). The back piece is removable to reveal a Micro SD card slot and two sim card slots (whaaaaaat?). I don't think the battery is removable and I didn't try. The plastic back is kind of hard to pry off and I'm always afraid it'll snap or crack but so far so good. The speaker is located in the back so it might sound a bit far away. I wasn't expecting crazy performance but it's pretty loud. Both the rear and front facing cameras have a flash, so you can now take selfies in somewhat good lighting. The camera isn't great at all but it is not the worst. It'll do for my MIL who's coming from some crappy LG phone. Unfortunately, the phone does not have NFC, so you will not be able to setup mobile payments with it.The software is pretty solid. The default theme gives me a MetroPCS vibe but aside from the amazon app, there are no traces of carrier bloat. Speaking of Amazon, I thought the ads would be bad but they only appear on the lockscreen. An easy swipe away unlocks the phone. Notifications will appear on top of the ad too so it won't get in the way. The phone runs marshmallow, which might be outdated but it is better than other phones being stuck on lollipop or lower. We popped a T-mobile sim card in and rebooted the phone. It was able to recognize the card and get us connected to T-mobile's network. Calls, text and Data all work.Performance is great. The phone has 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. Don't pick the cheaper 1GB and 8GB option, it's not worth it these days anymore. If you do need more storage, you can always insert an SD card. The best part is that the phone does allow you to run the SD as internal storage, a feature introduced with Marshmallow. Some companies like Samsung doesn't allow you to do it, even on their budget phones like the Galaxy On5 so this was nice. This means you can also install apps on the SD card and never run out of space when updating apps.I hope Amazon and BLU keep this phone updated for a while. It's a really good budget phone and has many features I didn't think it would have. If you need a cheap phone, a replacement phone until you get a new one, or a backup, this would be the phone to get. I'm going to purchase a second one to have as a backup.",

Even the viewing angles look perfect! As well as its easy and great to hold in the hands and very light seems lighter than my S6.  This is my first dual sim device which will come in handy. I own a number from an 80s song which mostly is there to collect calls and is on prepaid, but my plan with this device is have it on that line which is text/calls only for Sim 1 and then sim 2 is a data only sim from T-Mobile which provides 200MB of data each month for free so I have a fully featured 2nd phone in case I ever needed it. But that also leads to a con (more of that below)  I will also be using this as my Dash Cam in my car as well due to having a Micro SD slot and video quality seems more than enough.The camera is pretty good as well not as good as a high end phone of course but its better than any other in this price range I have posted a photo taken with this device here.One of my first noticed cons is the dual sim feature, which may not apply to everyone but My first sim for calls/text is an AT&T prepaid sim and my 2nd is a T-Mobile sim for Data 2G/3G/4G(LTE) But seems only 1 sim at a time can access any network other than 2G. So that means my non data AT&T prepaid sim will run on 2G only which will result in a problem come Jan 1st 2017, AT&T is shutting down there 2G network meaning I would no longer be able to use this in its current setup.But in all if I had to give up a flagship for a month or day or whatever to use this I defiantly could its usable! Makes a great 2nd phone and or backup phone.The Amazon Ads are not that intrusive and only show up on the lock screen which is not a bother to me.",

I still don't know what caused the problem, but I want to clear up the complaint - and maybe help others who may have the same thing happen to them.As I said in the original message, BLU R1 is a good product, certainly worth the price. Suggestion to the helpful BLU customer service: in a case like this, telling the user to keep pressing the on button first may be more helpful than sending the questionnaire about the product.Additional comment on 6/26/17:Everything works well on my BLU R1 HD - 8 GB, and I've been giving it good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, but keep running into one problem:With a *recognized* 30G memory card, which still has 29G free space, every time I try to install the latest (May) wireless update, I get this error message: \"There is no SD card present or there is not enough free space on device to complete the update.\"My latest attempt was at a T-Mobile store where after re-seating the SD card (just in case), I got the same error message.

    "text": "Let's just get it out of the way.  The BLU R1 HD is a good budget phone.  That statement is unquestionably true.  But what BLU has put out with the R1 HD is not only a good budget phone, but a good phone overall.  Long gone is the stigma that surrounded budget Android devices as laggy, unreliable and cheap feeling and this phone is the epitome of this new era.I review a variety of consumer electronics on my Youtube Channel and so I've been able to use quite a range of phones the last couple of years.  I've known about BLU for awhile now, but this is my first actual purchase of one of their phones.  I'm not going to claim this phone performs as well as a Samsung S7 or an iPhone 6s.  It isn't even Axon 7 or OP3.  It is nowhere near that and anyone who overhypes this because of the low price point to performance ratio is incorrect.  What I can confidently claim is that the R1 HD performs adequately for just about any user.  I've tested graphically intensive games and most of them were playable.  Navigating through Marshmallow was usually a pleasant experience with just the occasional hiccup.  You should however buy the upgraded version with 16 GB of storage and 2 GB of ram.  For only $10 more that is a must if you plan to use this phone as your daily driver.In terms of build quality, color me impressed.  While flagships have shifted to one of two materials; glass or metal, budget phones have stayed plastic.  There is something very satisfying holding the R1 HD and it's soft touch plastic back.  I didn't feel as if the phone was fragile.  The gorilla glass screen was also a surprising aspect that I didn't have high expectations for.  Yes, the display is only 720p and at 5 inches the PPI is barely acceptable at 294.  What videos here is confusing as the colors were warm and reminded me of amoled even though we are looking at IPS here.  What really gives this display an illusion of being premium is the \"curved\" glass.  No this isn't  S7 Edge curved glass, in fact I don't know why they don't just market it as 2.5D like everyone else because that's what this is.  Your fingers run along the edges very smoothly and for those uninitiated, you'd be hard pressed to guess that the phone was so cheap.  This screen promisingly feels like a Xiaomi Mi5 or OP3 quality screen.  Sadly the display quality didn't match but it is acceptable to most.Battery life is probably average to below average.  You're looking at 3 to 3 1/2 hours of SOT.  Performance is decent, but expect apps to have to restart due to the low amount of ram thus killing multi-tasking.  It's a minor annoyance but one you'd most likely not mind due to the price point.  Same thing goes for Amazon ads.  If you bought the Amazon ad model, you'll have to deal with your lock screen being polluted by Amazon ads.  It's nothing too detrimental, but some people will be annoyed with it after awhile.With that all said, we've officially reached Impulse Buy territory for smartphones.  Even if you didn't need a new phone, with it's expandable storage, you can easily purchase this and a bluetooth controller to use as an emulator console for trips.  It's hard not to recommend this phone to people as it really is just a decent average phone.  And that in itself is the biggest compliment you can give to a phone that is $60.",

Having the ads means your that your phone cannot display more than one notification on the lock screen. More than one notification? u get a 1+ sign.. and now u cant see any notification. The ad changes everytime i switch the display on (data usage?), and occasionally appears as the giant size ad, which takes up all the space, and hides all your notification. If possible, avoid the amazon version, unless you just can't be bothered... or am skilled at modifying your phone.",

    "text": "For the price, it's great bang for your buck, if you have prime and if you just need a phone. It has everything you need for the day to day stuff. Now, there are a few caveats especially if you're a developer.1: it does not come with a gyroscope or magnetometer, so positional tracking is a pain. Google maps likely won't show what direction you're going properly.2: proximity sensor doesn't really work. Mine seems stuck.3: No USB OTG, this is probably the biggest annoyance.and that's about it. It's a great phone as a normal consumer. Just wished it had a few more features as a hobbyist. consider the BLU R1 Plus if you think you're going to need any of the three features above. Otherwise, it's a pretty damn good deal.",

Some people have rumored that the ads lockscreen can be disabled with a 3rd party lockscreen app, but this is not true. It will just show you one lockscreen followed by the other (ads one). The recent update has quickly patched an internet posted 'hack' so... don't try too hard as you probably won't get anywhere! In any case the ads show up as a notification among others, if you have at least one notification. Otherwise it's full screen - sort of like on the Kindle Fire. Pretty sure it will be hard to root being on Marshmallow and having a locked bootloader but people might eventually figure it out.Build is good. It's sturdy (slightly heavier than it looked to me) but sleek and looks almost like the iPhone in its size and shape. The power button is below the volume rocker which can be a little strange to some. It even has the corning gorilla glass. The camera on the back sticks out a bit, kind of like on the iphone and other phones (I guess they can't make an 8mp camera slimmer) which makes me nervous about damage but the blu case will protect that.Performance is excellent. Marshmallow runs well. I have not had any lags, freezes, or bugs. Touchscreen feels and responds nicely (I have had touchscreen issues with another blu phone). Don't hold your breath on further updates on Android OS as Blu is notorious for breaking promises.Battery life lasts the day. To me it's pretty standard. Charging speed hasn't bothered me. Charger doesn't make high pitched squeaking like a previous Blu charger I had.There *IS* an LED notification light which I really appreciate. that shining beacon that tells you you have a missed text without having to wake your screen.Camera is better than I thought, just don't rely on it for award winning shots and you'll be happy. They're good enough to be focused and look decent. It's pretty impressive that it even has front flash.Dual SIM is nice as an option for people who travel or need a second line. I love the options on Marshmallow that allow you to control which SIM is the preferred one for calls, texts, and data. You can also just switch one off.Despite this being a \"budget\" phone, I will happily use this phone as my primary and only phone. :)",

    "text": "I bought this phone when my Samsung s3 stopped working after a couple of years. I didn't have a lot of money to put into a new one so I took a chance with this. It worked with my straight talk plan. I like it, and compared to my samsung, I would say what you are paying for is the ability to use apps and text and make calls. The camera isn't anything great, and for some reason  my GPS is weird but that might just be me. My favorite thing is that when you're using something on your phone and you get a call, the answer/dismiss buttons are at the top and out of the way so you don't hit one on accident.",

    "text": "Great phone for almost everything. I was surprised how much this phone reminded me of the premium phones that cost upwards of $500. If you don't have the money for an expensive phone, this one is definitely worth getting. I have had a few problems. Not sure if mine is a bit defective or if this happens to all devices, but whenever the phone updates, it removes some of my apps from the home menu and I have to go in and replace them. Also I seem to have problems with the alarms. Most of the time, alarms work fine and go off on time, but occasionally the alarm will not go off and will wait until I unlock the phone and then go off. For instance, I could have a countdown timer set to go off in 2 minutes but I wait the time and it doesn't go off. Then I unlock the phone and the timer says -37 seconds and starts going off... Additionally, I could have a morning alarm set to go off at 7:30am but I wake up at 7:33am and it hasn't gone off yet. Then I unlock the phone and it immediately goes off like nothing was wrong.Again, I don't know if my specific phone is defective but these few issues are enough to lower my rating to 3 stars. Still a great phone though even if it is a bit wonky for me.",

My text messages seem to go thru faster and so does my phone calls. I also notice my reception on some places I never got before now I do. The selfie front camera at 5 megapixel is awesome especially with flash. Not much new phones around that has a 5 megapixel with a flash right now even the galaxy s6 and iPhone 6 doesn't have that capability and your talking about a $600+ device.

For $59, you can't go wrong (Even at $110 with no ads.)The construction is top notch, buttons have a satisfying click, they don't rattle like some cheaply made phones.  This device definitely has a premium feel.  Screen is actually quite good at this price, can get fairly bright when needed.Some items to note:- It has a Notification LED (Also shows Red when charging, otherwise green.)- It does have a Ambient Light Sensor, it will automatically adjust screen brightness.- It does have Vibration Motor for alerts.- It doesn't have NFC so No Android Pay Support (expected for this price point.)- It doesn't have electronic Compass (again, for this price point is fine) as a result Maps will not rotate when viewed, but Navigation works fine.- MicroSD Cards can be used as Adoptable Storage (Make sure to use a fast good quality card, like a Samsung EVO+)- Battery life has been okay, but does drop fast from 100%, but stabilizes around 94%.- Camera is just okay, and the back LED is not very bright.- Ads aren't very obtrusive.- A little awkward to put in Micro Sim Card.  The metal frame slides forward and lifts up, you have to hold the card in place as you slide the metal frame back into place.I highly recommend this phone.",

As a photographer, the only feature I can wish for is image stabilization on low light conditions.  Other than that, the image quality captured by this phone is amazing.  Good for social media posting and a few taken, maybe destined for the art gallery.  As a phone, it answers and makes calls.  Texting works just fine.  Emailing and web surfing works well due to the stable Wifi feature.  Bluetooth works as well.  Amazon advertising is not bother some.  In fact, I've ordered from some Ads. Sometimes, they look like cool screen savers.  Battery lasts a whole day and more depending on what I'm using.  2hrs of playing Pokemon Go takes the charge down to 50%.  Screen is plenty bright.  Speakers are not loud enough sometimes but it's a phone.  I'm plenty happy with this phone.  Amazon should allow multiple purchases per account and not limit it.  I'd buy another for backup.  So far, it's very reliable.",

What really disappointed me is that I bought the phone for the dual simple capabilities.  I shortly found out that the second sim (as defined as the non data sim) would only connect to 2G.  A discussion with my provider embed in a disclaimer that their 2G network would be completely shutdown by the end of 2016.  The specs advertise that both sim slots are capable of 4G (which is true) but nowhere was I able to find any documentation that warned of only 2G.  I was also meet with frequent lagging and freezing.  I could not even consistently connect to my Fit bit.  Every time I opened the app I would be met with a \"the application is not responding\" message.Overall the phone was functional and had I not needed the second sim to work consistently I would have probably kept it as a backup.",

The voice quality is lacking. Voices sounded a bit muffled. The speaker on the the back of the phone is not very loud. The sound quality of music via Bluetooth or headphones is not great. It sounds a bit hollow no matter what kind of headphones I tried. And one thing that really bummed me out was that this phone will not be getting the official Android Nougat update.

For the price, one might think everything about this phone is cheap when truly it is only the price.Breakdown:First off, this is the fastest phone I have owned as I am coming from a previous WIndows Phone Lumia 520 and 640. The app store is plentiful, multi-tasking is seamless, and you can close multiple windows with one button.  The visual quality of the resolution is pristine when watching videos and viewing pictures. The speaker isn't quite as loud as my previous Nokia Lumia, however, the sound is much richer in quality. The interface is seamless and easy to use with many features that make being an Amazon Prime member even better.Verdict:Should you get it? For this price point, and even if you aren't a prime member it still is a killer deal comparable to higher end phones. The \"Ads version\" isn't as annoying as one would think as it only shows them on the lockscreen. I say, buy this and ditch your contract phone.

    "text": "Where do I Begin? This is easily the best phone you can buy for under $200. I have been using an iPhone 6 for the past year and when this thing announced, I was skeptical but curious about how a phone made by Blu, and subsidized by Amazon would be. The price tag was pretty incredible for what they are selling you, and it almost seemed to good to be true.I wont bore you with specs, you can read those anywhere. You want to know if this phone is good enough to be your daily driver. You want to know if this phone is up to the task of daily use and abuse. The answer is a resounding yes. I would not have believed it if I had not tried it for myself.I bought this phone, and brought over my work line (ATT) and my personal line (TING) over, and turned off my iPhone and placed it in the drawer.The phone activated quickly and I was up and going.Operating system is fantastic. Essentially what you have here is stock Android. Its nearly perfect. The only extras it has is Amazon apps; which while they are not removable, if you bought this phone for $59 you are most likely an Amazon customer, and will be installing these apps anyway.Stock launcher is great, everything being plan vanilla android is just perfection. Blu does not bother to reinvent the wheel here, and it was a great decision.The screen is clear and crisp. Its resolution is just ever so slightly lower than my iphone, but I do not notice much difference. Its bright, easy to read, and stays sharp at nealry all angles; something you dont see from cheap smart phones very often.The build quality is absolutely bananas. How did they get away with this? The build IS METAL, ITS METAL! Its solid, firm, feels expensive when you hold it. Maybe I have low expectations, but coming from using apple phones for the last few years, this thing is easily on par with the iPhone 6; in fact I would be willing to say the build is better. It does not creak or feel like it may bend in my pocket. Its even a bit heavier than the iphone 6, at least to me it seems heavier. I have not actually weighed the devices.The camera is probably the only place I feel this thing lacking. As many have said, the camera is a bit meh. However I will say that out of the box, the camera is set to 6MP. Be sure to adjust it in the settings to 8MP and pictures do wind up with sharper resolution; though the color performance and low light performance is still kinda meh. Its not *TERRIBLE*, just kind of okay.The battery life is good. Lasts all day so far. I charge it over night, and take it in the morning. I play music in the car over bluetooth, tapping out emails and texts, browsing reddit, and I got home at the end of the day with the battery at 25%. Thats not bad, better than the iPhone 6.The ads...yeah, they are there. They usually take the form of a simple small banner on the lockscreen. Occasionally I will get a full screen ad when waking the phone up, but they are never deal breaking or any real kind of nuisance.Thats pretty much it, the screen, the build quality, the dual sim ability, stock android 6.0...all those things add up to something that should cost much more than we are paying.iPhone 6 - $549 unlocked for 16GB with no option for an SD CardBlu R1 HD - $59 unlocked for 16GB with option for 64GB SD CardThis is really a no brainer. Buy it, enjoy it, and you will not regret it.",

It's not a powerhouse by any means, but it's working for me. I would recommend going for the 2 gb of RAM however since the 1 is sluggish. This would also make for a good first smartphone, as a backup, or even as a gift for an elderly person. One other thing I want to mention is that the OTA Update is not working for me, keeps giving me an error when trying to download, NOT FOUND. Stuck on this version, BLU_R0010UU_V6.6_GENERIC 23-08-2016 20:17. I took off a star since the updates seem to be broken.",

    "text": "Nice and solid phone. It does not have a lot of unnecessary features that other fancy phones has. However, this BLU R1 HD has everything that you would usually use on daily basis in your phone.I meant this phone does not have such features like MHL(video out to external TV), OTG USB (when you could connect external USB drive to your phone), screen resolution is only 1280x720 in compere to others that have 1920x1080, also there is no compass. May be there is something also, but I do compare with my previous phone. Anyway, all of the necessary features are still here, especially size of memory. This phone with 2GB RAM and 16GB Flash are killer, work very fast. Also, I have never really notice that screen resolution is smaller than on my previous one.And finally, the main killer in comparison to the fancy phones is price. I bought BLU R1 HD w/no add for $109.99 while for any fancy phone you will pay $500 - $700 for new unlocked or you will be held with your provider for couple years if you pay less.",

But getting back to this phone i need to say that is awesome. I wasn't expecting to much for its price but trust me it really exceeds any expectation.PROS:Screen- videos looks clear and very well balanced colors.Design- phone looks beatiful and the slightly curved on the edges of the screen make this phone to looks more than its value.Battery- battery is not bad its length me like 10 hours before charging ( casual use)OS- phone has marshmallow that good on a Blu because almost all have lollipop yet.LTE- lte speed are good.Neutral:Camera- camera isnt bad on overall but isnt the best. Front camera has flash so thats cool.Speaker- speaker isnt very loud.Overall phone is a good value phone i just paid $59 for the 2 gb version and im happy of that. The performance feels pretty solid . In my opinion if you are looking for a daily use phone  like for texting, talking, web surfing, social network,youtube and play some games like candy crush, angry birds, etc. This is one of the best on its price.",

I have had a range of phones of various price-points including several BLU phones  and the R1 compares very well.

This phone feels and responds just like any of the big name phones I've had in the past.  The lock screen ads aren't intrusive or distracting or bothersome in the least.  I was able to put my Tracfone SIM in and it didn't give me any trouble - booted right up, downloaded all my apps (after Google sign-in), updated whatever needed updating, and got right to work.  It is fast and switches between apps smoothly and quickly.  I haven't noticed any lagging or stuttering on video or streaming playback.I think the rear-mounted speaker is fine, however I am not normally in a position to need to use it for music; I work in an office so I need to use headphones to play music, and if I am at home I will use a larger, dedicated sound system.  However, for speakerphone I find it adequate - no better or worse than my last phone, which was a Samsung.  I would imagine a case with built-in kickstand would help to improve sound quality for those who need it.The screen is bright and crisp, the Marshmallow OS quick and responsive, and at this price this is a phone not to be missed.  In fact, even at full price this is a hidden gem of a phone!",

Like all Androids, there are some apps you can't move to the SD card, so that internal memory gets used up fast.Battery life is comparable to others. It's never as good as it's claimed. The battery is not removable, so keep that in mind. However, I find that light use will yield 4 days before I need to recharge. But you better plug it in your car's USB if you are using Waze or Google Maps - those really eat up the battery fast (I get a low battery warning after 4 hours of driving for Lyft if I forget to plug it in).This is my second Blu phone. In fact, this is kind of my 3rd, as this one is for my wife. My last one went almost two years before it had a mechanical issue and needed to be replaced. At this price, no need for insurance, just buy a new one.

    "text": "I had an App project that required 2 phones to test, and I was looking to buy the cheapest Android phone for testing. Amazon offered the BLU R1 HD, with the 16GB Storage/2GB RAM model going for $60. The 8GB/1GB model goes for $50. The catch is that the phone comes with Amazon ads scattered everywhere, and is pre-loaded with Amazon apps.For the price, I expected a slow, balky phone, but that was OK --- I wanted a phone just for testing, and I didn't care about performance. That it was unlocked was a bonus.Instead, the phone impressed me. It was fast (almost as fast as my Moto G, and for development purposes I can't tell the difference), and almost immediately updated its OS, connecting to my WiFi without a SIM installed. The ads, while they show up on the home screen, don't bother me at all.The places where costs are cut are the camera (which is relatively low quality, but good enough for receipts, etc) and the USB port: while my Moto G had no problem serving as a USB host for external flash drives, etc., the BLU R1 HD doesn't. And of course, the Moto G is waterproof. But for the same price, you can buy 3 of the BLU R1 HD! Compared to the Moto E, of course, the BLU R1 HD is superior --- there's no reason you should pay for a Moto E when you can get the BLU for the same price or less.By the way, I looked into getting a tablet instead so I could test a bigger screen size. No dice --- the decent ones cost way more than the equivalent phones. I guess tablet sales have fallen off a cliff so there's no economy of scale there any more.Recommended. It's a great development phone and a good general use phone.",

    "text": "The Blu R1HD is an excellent value and the perfect transition smartphone. I\u2019ve have multiple Android devices since 2010, and have seen Android grow and the devices that run it level out. I got caught up in the Note 7 and its recall, and needed a temp phone because I didn\u2019t want to transfer my T-Mobile lease to a loaner then back to a Note 7 whenever it becomes available again. I decided to give the $60 Amazon phone a shot and have been very pleasantly surprised, and it\u2019s likely you will be as well.First off, a bit about how I use my phone. I use a phone almost exclusively for messaging and social networking \u2013 texting, Twitter, Reddit, etc. I don\u2019t play games at all, I\u2019ll watch a short YouTube video every once in a while, but I don\u2019t typically consume a ton of media on my phone. I take an occasional photograph if something is interesting. I stream a lot of music. That\u2019s it. And what I\u2019ve come to realize is that I don\u2019t require a $300+ device to maximize these things anymore.HARDWAREThe R1HD is very light and feels like a budget phone. Soft touch back, mushy buttons, the build quality doesn\u2019t feel substantial especially when comparing it to an Apple or Samsung flagship. But that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t expect much at all from a $60 device. It\u2019s a good size in the hand and has a footprint comparable to the original Nexus 5. The screen, wrapped in rounded off Gorilla Glass 3 is a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s a 720p LCD 5-incher that gets the job done. I was concerned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate the lower resolution coming from the 1440p AMOLED panel on the Note 7, and while the R1HD isn\u2019t even in the same league, it\u2019s not bad for what I use it for. The lower resolution is fine for reading text and viewing pictures. The display is workmanlike and pretty good overall.To be blunt, both the speaker and the camera are absolutely horrible on this thing. The speaker is tinny and not even remotely loud enough. If it wasn\u2019t for vibration, I would miss most of my notifications. The camera is the only real potential hardware deal breaker I can find with the R1HD \u2013 if you take a decent amount of pictures, this phone is simply not for you. You\u2019ll have to pay a little more money to get something better.The processor gets the job done for my tasks. Benchmarks are meaningless to me since I don\u2019t use any resource heavy apps. The 2 GB of RAM is fine. The 16 GB of storage is fine, and an SD card is adoptable so that can increase easily. Music sounds good over headphones. Battery life is good and standby time is excellent. There is barely any idle drain when the screen is off. If you\u2019re a light phone user, especially, this should get you about a day and a half on a single charge. Heavy users can also easily make it through the day.SOFTWAREThe software is 99% stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and that\u2019s a very, very good thing. Blu has kept the bloatware and customizations to a minimum. Stock Android is very fluid on the R1HD. The apps that can\u2019t be uninstalled can at least be disabled, except for the main Amazon app. The included lock screen advertising is what it is. I recommend keeping an app running that has a persistent notification, such as WeatherBug which displays the current temperature in the top bar at all times. This way, every time you see the lock screen the ad is displayed as a normal size notification card instead of taking up the entire screen. I haven\u2019t had any issues with app compatibility or instability.OVERALL PROS/CONS++ The thing is $60 and fully featured++ Stock Android Marshmallow++ Surprisingly nice screen++ SD card supports adoptable storage++ 4G LTE\u2013 Feels cheap\u2013 Terrible, terrible camera\u2013 Wimpy speaker\u2013 Ads built inThe Blu R1HD is, for the most part, an unbeatable bargain. For the price of a date night you get a fluid, unlocked Android phone that runs the same apps as phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. Even if you don\u2019t put a SIM card in and just use it as an MP3 player it\u2019s a heck of a deal. That said, the camera a truly horrible and the principle of the lock screen advertising may turn some people off. Still, there\u2019s something to be said about not worrying about dropping or damaging a phone, carrying what is essentially disposable. The thing costs $60 \u2013 and grading on that curve, this is a no brainer as a backup or transition phone. I would only recommend it as a daily driver if you don\u2019t need a passable camera, otherwise it would be fine for the average user.",

I've tried calling voicemail twice this way, and each time it calls 911, and I am UNABLE to end the call. Is it some sort of safety feature to be able to call if you are abducted or need to secretly call 911? Not sure, but I HATE this.",

    "text": "The reason you are on this page is that you want a cheap, unlocked smart phone.  I'm comparing this phone to other freebie-with-contract carrier smart phones that many know and love, not the top-of-the-line phones from your favorite two rivals.Pros:- Cheap, unlocked, and a smart (android) phone.- Very usable in most common apps- Good display and UI- HW works fineCons:- The ad software seems a little flakey, occasional lockups, particularly during full screen apps (i.e. pokemon)- The phone seems to go AWOL every so often and gets hung up for no apparent reason, I believe it's the ad software- Seems very crashy even for AndroidSo I get it, the ads were part of the price of the phone. If the ads don't get displayed, the vendor doesn't get paid. They are then, going to be more obnoxious and intrusive than I would like, but stating this upfront is actually more fair and reasonable than most carrier phones with horrid shovelware you don't discover until it is too late. However, it seems to make a product that people would want to buy, and want to continue to use in order to make you that ad money, there is an obligation on your part as a designer to ensure that the software does its job without frustrating the user, which is often the case with this phone. The ads can and often do get in the way of using the device, particularly if you're in a place with spotty LTE. That is my major gripe about the phone.We purchased this when my wife's Nexus 5 died 1.5 years after purchase. We did not want to invest in a good phone so close to next year's launch, and $50 seemed like a reasonable price to tide us over for 6 months. We didn't regret the purchase, but at the same time she is still anxiously awaiting the unlocked iPhone 7 Plus. This represents a decent bridge phone, or perhaps something to give to a kid for after school emergencies (which is what it will be in its next life). I would still purchase this phone again rather than get a locked carrier phone of any variety, but by no means would I choose to live this way if I have the means to buy an unlocked phone of higher caliber.",

Says it would take about 20 mins only took me about 10 mins. It accepted my T-Mobile sim with not issues and I also install an SD card. I love that it gives you an option on how to setup the SD card. Either in phone mode where all data from app and everything will be stored on it. Or in backup mode where you can store pics and music and other things of that sort and then your able to take it out and plug into any other device and it works. This phone was a bit slimmer than what I'm use to but it makes it easier to hold in the hand. It has some weight to it though so it really does not feel cheap. I would so buy another one.",

    "text": "The Blu R1 HD has been a very capable phone since I got it.  The Amazon ads are non-invasive and only show on the lock screen, and only prominently when you don't have a bunch of notifications.  There was an instance early on when I had to reboot it because it got very slow and unresponsive, but that only happened once and hasn't happened since.  To be clear, I got this as a backup phone to put a Project Fi Data SIM in and use when going to the pool or amusement park where I don't necessarily mind if something happens to it vs. my Nexus 6P. I'm excited for the prospect of using it with my Project Fi Data SIM.  I've made several calls over 4g LTE data using Hangouts and my Project Fi account and found it to be even better quality than normal mobile calls. What is a disappointment, though, is the WiFi.  Even indoors near my WiFi router, this phone would vary wildly in it's reception.  When making a Hangouts call the call would break up depending on the position of my head and whether it was between the phone and router or not.  Where my Nexus 6p gets great WiFi reception, the Blu R1 HD gets about half that signal strength. This phone does not have all the extra bells and whistles you will find on feature phones.  Here's some things you do and don't get:What you DON'T get:- NFC- USB via an OTG cable- Stock Android with root out of the box- Quick charging- MHL (For HDMI output via the USB port)What you DO get:- An average rear and front facing camera with flashes for both (selfie flash was an unexpected surprise)- A \"Near Stock\" Android Marshmallow experience- Two SIM slots (convenient for when you are traveling and have a data SIM but need prepaid voice)- 4g LTE on US based GSM networks (TMobile, AT&T;, etc. but NOT on Verizon or Sprint based carriers)Bottom line is that a LOT of people who are hard on phones or are barely getting by with a broken iPhone and can't afford a new one, may well consider coming over to Android to get an inexpensive new phone like this.  It certainly looks to be a great replacement for a really old or broken phone where someone doesn't want to add that extra $20 - $30 to their mobile payment for 2 years to pay for that new iPhone or high end Android phone.",

    "text": "UPDATE:  my  Blu R1 HD has  been having battery issues. i researched  it a bit and  it seems  when we get  an update at  SOME  unknown time it will take care of it.  it's  not a hardware  issue it's a software issue. just thought  i'd let  you good folks  know bout this.  something about it using  more  power when on standby  than when in actual use.  so, supposedly  it'll be fixed whenever Blu  update's  the  OS.  or  so the dev's are saying.  :D cheers!  I still LOVE the darn thing!I've been cruising  for a sim card  cellphone for a few  weeks.  this  popped  up on my prime account and  after thinking  on it a few hours, i snagged it.  as for the  phone itself.  man this is the ABSOLUTE NICEST  cell i've ever had!  it  looks  slick, using it is  simply FLAWLESS!! i mean it is a BEAUTY!!in my  opinion she's fast, handles everything well,  not tested the calling ability as  i'm awaiting  my sim cards to get here. i loaded some  movies  i had  on my pc hardrive and they played perfectly!  now, i did try  n watch braveheart via netflix.  there was occasionally a  slight hesitation in the  playback. a  minor issue in my  opinion.  i'm blown away by the screen.  it's so vibrant and  just all around a treat  to see.  it's solid  in the hand, i've  moderately large hands  for a female, and  this sits  oh so comfy  like in my hand.  the buttons were WELL placed!! i know  on one of my  other  phones  i always  hit the volume  buttons, had  to be conscientous  to make sure the  sound was  up to hear  it ring.  no such issue  with blu!! i played a  few  video games  via emulators. it performed  perfectly!  it was a  joy to play games  on.i played  some  music.  REALLY good sound. folks for  $59.95?  WELLLLLL worth  it!!i AVIDLY await  my Sim cards arrival so i can take this baby for a FULL test drive! :D 1  issue though, i've had  this 2 days or thereabouts and  for the  LIFE of me  i cannot get to my amazon app's list!! I  LOATHE  amazon underground and  on all my other devices use  the separate \"amazon app store app\". WELL on this? it  simply won't work.  if ANYONE has a workaround for this? i'd be seriously  blissfully happy to get that  info and  get  it running  on my  blu.UPDATE: i broke down n downloaded  \"Amazon underground\" and through there  is  a \"your apps\" link..so i CAN get to my apps, but it's way more effort than the  old  \"amazon appstore app\"  progress DOESN'T mean adding  more steps to do the SAME EXACT JOB, folks. that's  not PROGRESSION, thats DIGRESSION.  think about it.  the phone still ROCKS!! despite this silliness. :D  I'm surprised how SOLID this feels!!  you  know  cells  at this price are  somewhat, hmm, flimsy? fragile?  not this one.  i'm just tickled pink!!

    "text": "My expectations of this phone before I bought it was low because I just wanted a phone dedicated to taking and receiving phone calls for my medical appointments from the VA.  I already have an iPhone 7 plus for all the bells and whistles a phone can provide.  I was pleasantly surprised that this phone has a similar look to my Tmobile Sony Xperia Z1S and similar specs to my Samsung Galaxy S4 which is fine by me.  I realized later that I could have taken advantage of California lifeline program because I am on Medicaid I could've gotten a free android phone with free monthly service, but I would sacrifice such an aesthetically looking phone in the Blu R1 HD.  Right away I was able to update the software which enabled Tmobile LTE Band 12 and it is, but I can't figure out why VoLTE doesn't work even though the software description said that it would bring VoLTE to the phone.  I guess I can't complain about that.  My signal drops to 4G during phone calls and reverts to 4G LTE after the phone call ends.  I do know that voices are clear during phone calls.  1280x720 resolution on this 5\" inch screen looks nice to my surprise as I have been spoiled in the past with 2k screen resolutions on my S7 Edge.  The only small gripe I have is the speaker on the back of the phone is not loud.  As a phone that its main purpose is making phone calls, I am extremely satisfied with this phone.  Can't beat $65 dollars to buy this phone.  Also, the ads aren't at all intrusive you just swipe them away like any other notification.  I highly recommend this phone if you don't need all the bells and whistles like a Samsung Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 plus.",

    "text": "I switched to this phone from a Moto X because I wanted to use a cheaper phone service. This phone is significantly slimmer. As already noted by some reviewers, this phone does not have NFC. The glass pour on the screen leaves a \"rounded\" look (other than perfectly flush or flat into the bevel), which is something different than I have seen on other phones, this might bother some; however this does not bother me. The other missing feature is USB host mode which seems to be missing in the firmware. Also the first day I got it, I tried to load the Starbucks app and it would continuously crash. However there was a wireless update and it appears to no longer crash. Another strange thing that keeps happening, my Dolphin browser keeps getting removed from the device for absolutely no reason. Onto the good: It feels good in the hand, it has sufficient bulk to not feel cheap and plasticy like some Kyocera phones. The physical buttons feel like the Blu HD Win LTE phone, which I particularly like. The charge port on the front requires you to plug the phone in with the cable flipped the other way round. I would have preferred the speaker to be in the front. Overall, for the money this is hands down the best phone per dollar spent anywhere, without argument. I have the amazon ads supported version, and I do not find the ad integration disruptive at all. The amazon app integration would be less useful to those who do not already have Amazon Prime. (Auto unlocking via Smart Lock will not work with this device due to the lock screen showing regardless of your Smart Lock settings.)  I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a good value smartphone.There is a bug that presently will remove your Dolphin or Firefox browser from your phone upon reboot if installed to external memory. I am confident that a fix is forthcoming.  Also it may be worth noting to some that the daydream feature will also not work on this version of the phone, due to the restrictions placed on the lock screen. Checked on 7/23/16 and it is still removing browser on reboot.UDATE: 8/7  Blu has isolated the issue and it appears to be a common bug for Android M. A work-around would be to sideload the browser. I feel like a fix is imminent and am very satisfied with the level of communication with this company. <3 Blu.7/26: Sorry if my phone screen looks dusty in the video, the screen protector with the blu case is abysmal.Blu HAS contacted me via email. I am very impressed with their customer service so far. They have been very straightforward with me and I feel very confident in their knowledge and abilities.If you order the Blu R1 HD case, I highly recommend throwing the screen-protector away and getting a Zagg or Xtreme one.",

    "text": "This phone is the best bang for your buck without a doubt. Yes it can play Pokemon Go.Power: I've been adding a lot of apps and it can almost everything. Any standard android game it can handle. Fallout Shelter looks great in highdef on this thing. It's been fast and snappy. I've had a few times when it has bogged down but it doesn't happen often. Navigating between apps is fast and responsive. I don't notice any lag when I swipe the screen. The voice controls work well too without too much delay.Screen: The screen is really good for the budget. It gives you high def 720p visuals without the cost. The screen is also nice and durable. I've already dropped it in the dirt during a run and it's had no blemishes. You can easily clean it and you don't need to worry about a screen protector. I did get one for it but it just wasn't as good as going bare, especially when the screen is this tough. The curved edges are also very pleasing aesthetically.Sound: The sound is probably the worst thing about the phone. It isn't very loud but it is definitely reasonable. I can hear the other person on a call but I do wish it was louder. It does have a headphone jack which is getting rarer these days. I've also had no problems with the bluetooth audio.Camera: Not the greatest but it's sufficient for the price of the phone. It also gives a nice bright light for flashlight mode. I think both sides have a flash but I've normally just used it as a flashlight.Other features:It uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow which is one of the latest operating systems from android.The only newer one is 7.0 Nougat on the latest samsung phones. What does this mean? Well every operating system improves on the last and compared to a prepaid phone of the same price they usually run on previous versions.  Having it unlocked is great too. I was able to pop in my active sim card from my prepaid Cricket phone and it worked seamlessly, I didn't have to visit a website or call anyone. Also you can easily switch between two different sim cards in the settings if you want two numbers.Amazon offers: I guess this part is kind of annoying but not that obtrusive. If you are up to you can spend the time to get rid of it, but I won't go into details in case Amazon gets mad at me for it. I have a kindle that has the same kind of offers and you usually don't notice them after you get used to it. Another drawback of this phone is the company BLU almost never updates their phones. They say they will but don't hold your breath. Apparently this phone is Band 12 capable physically but the software isn't there for it, so many are waiting on an update. I have heard success from modifying and turning it on yourself but then you would have to put some work into it like getting rid of the ads.All in all it's probably the best phone you can buy now for less than $100 no I'm not counting $99 phones. The latest moto G play might be better but it was announced on amazon the day I got this phone! I'm extremely satisfied as someone coming from a super cheap phone. I probably won't need to upgrade for a while with this phone.",

    "text": "This is a very nice phone.  For the price, this is a great phone.I've never been one to spend the huge bucks on the latest and great phone.  So I'd never even consider spending $650+ for the newest flagship phones.  Several years back, I tried the Blu Life Play and loved it.  Even after the charging usb port stopped working, I order the same phone 18 months later.  I used that last Blu Life Play up until this past December (2015) when I dropped it and it would no longer boot past the BLU screen.I immediately get onto Amazon and search for new phone.  After looking at the BLU Life Play again, the price had not seemingly dropped much from the prior purchase and I found an Samsung Galaxy S3 for just a few dollars more than the BLU.  So I purchased it.  After using it about 4 months and hating the buttons, flip cover, and the constant overheating, I decided to switch to a Galaxy S4 that my wife purchased a couple months earlier before settling for an iPhone.  While the S4 did not overheat like the S3, it still did not give me a satisfying feeling.Then Amazon offered this BLU R1 HD with Ads for $59.99.  After checking the $49.99 one first, I decided to go for the extra RAM.  After figuring the ads couldn't be too bad, I went for it.This phone is great thus far. It feel good in my hand and is seemingly the perfect size for my hands.  The phone's display is beautiful.  I love the volume rocker and power being on the same side of the phone.  This prevents the accidental volume change when turning the screen off or the powering off when attempting to change the volume.  Now I will say, Amazon really went all in with their advertising on this device.  You must dismiss an ad each time you turn on the screen, before unlocking or using the device.  While sometimes aggravating, the ads are inserted fairly nicely into the screens.  I'm not saying I like the ads, but I am saying the design was well thought.  I am a little disappoint that Amazon decided it needed to further advertise to its already, likely faithful, Prime base.Specs-wise, I believe the phone is solid.- 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek 6735 ARM Cortex processor- 16 GB Internal Memory with 2GB RAM- 5\" Gorilla Glass 3 Display- Android 6.0- Micro SD slot <64GB- 8MP/5MP rear/front camera- 4G network support- Dual Sims for international travel or using multiple networks- GPSI typically use my phone on speaker quite a bit.  This phone's speaker does not go as loud as I'd like, but is manageable.  The ear piece sound is similar, if not slightly better than that of the S4.  It does not have a removable battery, but it does include a more than sufficient 2,500mAh Li-Polymer battery.My Summary:  This phone is a great phone and operates extremely smooth.  The camera alone is not the best, but if you start recording with flash on, and use the snapshot option while recording, you can achieve must better picture quality and faster snap reaction.  This is really the best way to use the camera.  Simply stop and delete the recording once done.  I don't play any graphic intense gaming, so I can't speak to it, but for some gaming and video/movie watching this phone delivers well.  The hardware specs are more than suitable for most all non-intense graphic gamers.  For the price, this phone is an amazing value, even with the ads.  For superusers, this phone is an absolute steal.  Even at the standard, non ad price of $109.99, the phone is a good value.  I think I'm going to get a hold of a second one for backup purposes.",

Several times throughout the day, the R1 hotspot disconnects and will not reconnect (stay connected is turned on). I know it is not due to me or my carrier (T-Mobile) because I have an iPhone 7 plus which never disconnects has much faster download speeds.

The results speak for themselves; Download is 1.41 mbps for the BLU, 9.45 for the iPhone. Curiously, the BLU upload is 3 times faster but that is irrelevant with the unacceptably poor DL. I've spent hours fiddling with the BLU ( rebooting, turning the hotspot off and on, switching SIMS, etc.) and I see no cause for these problems.

I have to literally shout to make voice audible to other, similarly, I have to be always on speaker to at least hear what others are speaking.2.

Purchased this phone to replace my Alcatel ONETOUCH Fierce XL which is supposed to be a little faster than this phone according to specs. However the Alcatel was bulky, slow, and had a poorly sensitive screen compared to this beautiful bargain of a phone. The two things that I don't like on this phone are the crappy speaker and the curved screen but those aren't deal breakers for me. The reason the speaker doesn't bother me too much is because if I want good sound, I am going to use headphones or a wireless speaker system. The bloatware on this phone isn't too heavy compared to other phones I have had in the past as well.",

This phone will do for the shorterm, but I expect to replace it within a year.Camera is very good. I really like the front and rear flash and a portrait mode that isn't too far behind iPhone. Besides the Amazon apps preloaded, there isn't bloatware on here, which is a positive.Apps do tend to crash on a fairly regular basis, especially Facebook and Instagram. When they do you have to reboot the phone. About half the time this throws it into a reboot loop and it reboots four to five times in a row.Overall, I would recommend as a good low cost phone. It will do the job until I want to buy a higher cost phone. Now that Amazon has the Nokia 6 available, I may give that a shot in the fall.",

The best smartphones cost ten times that much and this device is very close to them.  This device is better than my Galaxy S5 although some of that may be the newer Android version.  The two knocks are the camera and the Amazon ads.  The camera isn't as good as my Galaxy so if this is a deal breaker, you're welcome to spend $540 more.  That said the camera works fine for me good lighting.  And I don't really notice the Amazon ads.  Again, if the tailored ads in all the websites you visit bother you, then you can pay more.  The device is very generic Google which I like without all the customization from the carrier or the manufacturer.

The quad core processor and two gigs of RAM make using the phone a smooth and satisfying experience. Spend the extra ten bucks for this model over the 1gb/8gb model.

    "text": "This phone is an absolute steal for $60. It is a really good value at $110, but when subsidized by Amazon, it e there another category. For most, $60 for a piece of technology is almost an impulse purchase price. For $60, you get an LTE, GSM network compatible smartphone with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of system memory, a decent mediatek CPU and 5 inch IPS LCD screen.You also get a 5MP front camera with a flash and a rear 8MP camera.The phone comes with the latest version of Android, 6.0.1, and a micoSD card slot.  Most phones this cheap are still on Android 5.1.Since this phone is subsidized by Amazon, Amazon will display ads on the lock screen. I am happy to say that they actually look nice and require you to press an easily identifiable on-screen button to go to Amazon. No sneaky tricks here. Once you are past the lock screen, the phone is on bone stock Android with the addition of 6 or so Amazon apps installed, like IMDB, audible, and of course, Amazon shopping.The lock screen ads and a few pre-installed apps more than make up for the $50 price reduction of the phone.The phone is not perfect, most notably in the rear camera, which is slow to focus. Also, the battery is not removable.However, if you want a cheap phone to play with , a backup phone for emergencies, or even a Wi-Fi capable Android MP3 player with a camera and a screen, buy this phone.

My weather app keeps the ads minimized on the lock screen so it is a non-issue. I will update this review if i begin to have issues. Also, the BLU discounted case (during checkout) has also worked well for protecting the phone.

    "text": "Revision to my previous review:I have bought a number of phones in the past, and have never written a review.  I am so disappointed with this phone however,  that I feel I should warn others.  I spent hours researching quality budget phones, and since this was highly rated across the board as well as an Amazon choice, I was very optimistic.The biggest flaw, and the reason I am now buying a new phone, just three months after purchasing this,  is the sound quality.  I am constantly being told that people cannot hear me, even when I sit in a quiet area and speak directly into the phone.  Using headphones or a Bluetooth is not even an option.Other issues:~Poor volume.  It is impossibly to make the phone loud enough for a ring  to be heard from another room.~Poor battery.  The battery is slow to charge, and doesn't hold a charge for an entire day.  Since it has an internal battery, I am unable to bring a spare with me, so I need to take a charger wherever I go.I really should have given it one star, but there are some redeeming qualities, (not worth mentioning,) in light of everything else.Good luck finding a better phone.Revision to my previous 2 star review:Since my review, I have received nearly weekly requests to answer questions about this product, since after all, as a reviewer I\u2019d be a good source of info. Ha.  I have refrained from answering these requests, choosing instead to allow the customer to make their own decision. But this has been getting a tad annoying.  One would think they would select which customers to ask for further info.At this point, my BLU R1 has been collecting dust in my home, since my attempts to return it have been unsuccessful.

Coming from a Samsung Galaxy SII that I paid about three times as much for (used, to boot), this phone is like a fine European luxury automobile to the Samsung's Korean econobox. Now, to be fair, the Samsung was probably considered pretty highly specced when it was new, but honestly, I was blown away by the quality, features and performance of this phone. The size is a bit larger than my old phone, which I though would turn out to be a minus. However, I like the larger size of the BLU phone - it doesn't turn sideways as easily in my hip pocket, and it is more comfortable to hold, particularly when holding it to the ear for calls (I have average-sized hands, I think). Amazon ads are unobtrusive, though I am kind of conditioned to ignore them, as I have an ad-subsidized Kindle Fire as well. Overall, I am ecstatic with my purchase. Activation was easy-peasy. I had ordered a CDMA SIM card from my carrier a few days before the phone arrived. I popped it in the phone, followed the prompts on my carrier's web site (Ting), and within a half hour my number was ported and everything just worked.",

As a matter of fact, I got this for Metro PCS to replace a broke phone, I have given it a fair shake and here is the good and bad of it.The Good: Price, up to date firmware, good camera, clear screen, and holds a charge for a good time.The BAD: Man is thing twitchy on the side button, Reception is iffy (this is a BIG problem), it tends not to respond to touch after sleeping, and there just isn't any case or screen savers available other than Amazon. (not really their fault it is their special offer but it is a bit annoying)Look this is not a bad phone but it isn't a good one either its more just mehhhh. It does what it needs to do (when it's awake) but the pick up from the antenna is just a bad piece of technology. Compared to the old Samsung I had it was just no match.

Both great phones and both have better specs than the R1HD. They were released 2-4 years prior and definitely more expensive.The phone has a good looking screen, 720p, I don't think I can tell the difference between that and a 1080p screen. This phone is definitely a looker with metal like border wrapped around the 5inch screen. Plenty of screen for myself, I have medium sized hands and don't have much of an issue with navigating one handed.  It does have front and rear facing cameras with flash on both sides, I can say it does take good stills but not great quality that you would see on a phone of a bigger price tag. I can't say anything about video. I haven't tried that yet.  The UI is close to stock Android Marshmellow. The phone is easily customizable, but if you would like to do more then rooting is a route to go. I haven't myself, I don't require it for any device unless the UI is dreadful. The ads aren't a big deal after a while you seem to get used to it, or even won't notice them when there are other notification on the lock screen. The ad become miniaturized and hardly noticeable. With 2 gigabytes of RAM, and 1.3 GHz  processor it more than enough to run all your Apps. I only played a couple of games and they seem to run well.Overall its a good buy if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone you would need to upgrade in a year or two.",

(Note: I wasn't going to pay over $100 for a phone and this seemed like the best value.)  The one thing that worried me was not about the phone, but my carrier AT&T.;  I have always heard that when you put your sim card from a non-smartphone to a smartphone it will automatically charge you for a data plan if you don't already have one.  So I went ahead and talked with customer support and they confirmed that since data was block on my sim, it has been blocked for like the past 10 years, that it will not charge me for a data plan but I would still have to manually turn off data for the phone, which was easy enough to do.  So now I have a smartphone without a data plan.  Say all you want about that, but I really don't need data as there is free WiFi everywhere around me.The phone is amazing.  The only real problem I had with it was that it took me a while for my sim card to fully pop in.  But other than that, it has been great.  I have all the apps that I wanted and they all run smoothly.  Took me a bit to get my own custom ringtone and alarm tones because god forbid you be able to make a custom song a ringtone, which I could easily do that with my piece of crap flip phone.Anyway, it is probably the best bang for your buck in the cheap smartphone market.

The fact that it is running the current release of Android is a huge plus.  The screen is nearly as big as the Blu Life X One (which I also own), and the brightness and clarity is almost equal.  The phone does not come with a set of earphones, but you'd do better to buy a better quality set anyway.  Some of the newer nice Android features such as on screen gestures and NFS or quick charge are missing from this phone, but considering you get a fairly decent front and rear camera, a quad core processor, and 2gb memory with 16gb storage, plus two SIM card slots and a 64gb micro SD slot, and this is one amazing deal.  Call quality is also remarkably good, and some fairly ample apps like games work reasonably fast.  All in all, a great phone for a casual user, or as a backup/travel phone.",

Performance has been comparable to my Nexus 5X (for which this has been a temporary replacement),  which cost 5 times as much!Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- It runs near-stock android, and runs it well- Very smooth system performance. It's been able to run all applications I've thrown at it thus  far.- Attractive and sturdy build. I've dropped it several times and have only gotten a few minor scuffs.- Amazon ads. I thought they would be horrible and intrusive. In fact, I hardly notice them and they don't seem to be taking up much, if any, data.Cons:- I do miss the ability to use fingerprint authentication and Nfc payments, but those features are definitely not expected at this price point- As part of the discounted Amazon version, you get unremovable Amazon apps. While annoying, this is to be expected with the subsidy that Amazon gives you.- The camera is definitely subpar, but I consider that to be a relatively minor tradeoff for the excellent system performance.If you do end up purchasing this phone, I would highly recommend you opt for the 2 GB ram/16 GB rom model.

To be honest, after 3 days I don't even notice the ads. I replaced a Nexus 5x with this phone and I can't really say I miss my Nexus. I was looking for a dual sim phone because I've been carrying two phones for a few years now and frankly it's annoying. If you are a small business owner or do a lot of traveling with business the second line on the same phone is a must. I haven't had any lag or performance issues which was a surprise. The software is nearly stock android so that made my switch even easier. The camera gets the job done. It's not going to wow you but it should satisfy your instagram needs. Battery life has been average yet far better than my 5x. The screen is sharp and bright and does well in outdoor light at max brightness. The 16gb of storage is a non-issue because you can use a micro sd as either expandable storage or as internal storage. Build quality is excellent. It feels nice in the hand and has a secure grip. The beveled edges on the glass give it a high end feel. I would highly recommend this phone.Update: I have had some issues with apps loading and crashing. I found the cause to be my slow speed micro SD using it as internal storage has doubled the space on the phone and some apps download directly to it. Be sure to use a fast micro SD to remedy this issue. Another fix is to simply move those downloaded apps to the internal storage of the phone and the problem disappears.  30 days later...it still performs well and for the most part gets the job done with only a few drawbacks.

It's also very thin and ight (only 5 ounces and 0.33\" thick), feels durable, and can fit in a hip pocket or almost anywhere.  Plus the memory can be expanded and merged with the on-board memory, which for a phone with only 8 GB of onboard memory is almost a must.The phone does come with ads but they are not in your face and don't interfere with the experience.  I don't think there's any reason to spend the extra $50 to get rid of the ads, it doesn't take from the experience as well.That said, don't expect a state of the art handset.  I do push my phones hard, and the phone did seem a little slow running some animations and apps; additionally, the default alert tones didn't sound great (somewhat distorted and loud at least for me).  Oddly, the speaker is on the back of the handset, so when playing music if the phone sits flat on a table it will sound muffled.  The original Amazon phone was a better piece of hardware, but considering the price points and overall experience going into a partnership with BLU was a smart move for the 'Zon.Keep your expectations reasonable and you'll enjoy this.",

It is less powerful, but comparable or superior in power consumption. It also has the advantage of being inexpensive, and so disposable. It's screen is so-so.

It can play PSX games at full speed without hiccup, but the experience is limited by the mediocre screen and build quality.

I needed an unlocked phone to go with my legacy $30 unlimited data plan, to replace my Nexus 4 that was now and then not waking up from sleep (and had to be manually powered off and back on).  The screen on the R1 HD just blew me away, much brighter and sharper than expected.  The processor was quick with no noticeable lag for the kind of web surfing I do.  And the battery life was phenomenal -- I don't even have to charge it every night.  The most exciting bonus was the microSD card slot inside the back cover, that I can expand my storage beyond the 16GB of the phone itself.  I use the microSD card mainly to load variety of media for long plane rides.Some reviewers have complained about the Amazon ads and offers on the $60 Amazon prime exclusive pricing. I'm not an Amazon fan, although I do buy things through them, so I wasn't sure how this would work out.  But I'm happy to say that it has become a non issue.  Ever since I installed my favorite weather app with continuous notification on my phone, the full screen Amazon ads and offers were reduced by the weather notification to a small unobstrusive half inch bar across the lockscreen, just like another notification.  So it was a no big deal!  Thus, this $60 smartphone represent to me the absolute best value on the market.",

But what are the drawbacks? for this special deal amazon imposes ads on the user's lockscreen, which are fullscreen when there are no notifications present, and are shrunk down to match the notifications when they are present. Combine this with the fact that the ads are targeted, and you likely won't mind them very much if at all. Still, at a normal price of $110, there must be a bigger catch. You won't get that super necessary 4k phone display, but 720p HD looks plenty sharp at this size. You might miss some features like quickcharging, and even double-tap to wake, but these are features you can live without. At higher volumes the distortion is very noticeable, and accuracy is an issue at all volumes, but it definitely gets loud enough so that your notifications and alarms work fine. 16GB storage is not a lot, but decent, and it can be expanded with a microsd card up to 64gb. It even has two micro-sim slots for dual-sim functionality.Really, the saddest thing is how backwards thinking the designers were.

There is no fix for for this.  Rebooting, clearing the app cache, clearing the app data, force stopping the app, disabling & re-enabling, wiping the cache partition ... try whatever you like, but the only way to restore the phones functionality is a factory reset. Even after installing an app that blocked calls from unknown/private numbers, the calls still crashed the phone despite being blocked. Blu uses a modified version of the stock Android phone app, and you cannot use Google Play to update to a more recent version which may solve the problem. In the month since I bought this phone I have spent ridiculous amounts of time trying unsuccessfully to solve the  problem, and repeatedly doing factory resets. When I finally gave up and went to return the phone, Amazon told me I'm 2 days too late. I guess that's what I get for making the effort to fix the problem myself. Should have returned it immediately at the first sign of trouble.",

I am planning on using it for longer than planned as it works very well as a smartphone in terms of apps, internet, battery life. One thing is that the ads are quite annoying, but you get used to them. Camera is very basic so don't expect to be taking high resolution pics. Other than that for its price I highly recommend it.",

Once the update was installed, the phone could no longer find the sim card making the phone portion of the unit totally unusable.  WIFI still worked, however I needed the phone for making and receiving calls.  I attempted to call BLU for a resolution to the problem, but the numbers I located were not working numbers.  I returned the unit to Amazon.  I really liked the unit and for the price was a very good unit at first, but the support by BLU was so lacking and how could I rely on a phone if it wasn't going to work after the update process.  Hopefully they will correct there problems, as I truly think this would be a great smartphone if it was supported.",

    "text": "The phone was what I expected and more. It was beautiful and simple. Something about the full screen, button-less display made the phone easy on the eyes, if not wonderfully intriguing. It also did not have all the bloatware that every phone comes with. This phone was essentially android at its finest, running only the most necessary features and apps. (But, you could download just about anything on the Play Store or the Amazon App store, if you really miss the bloatware!) In addition, it was wonderful to have a memory card slot! Many mainstream phones nowadays are skipping out on this option, so it was nice to have a phone that could handle an extra 64 gigs! And the best part about it was that connecting it to my service provider was effortless. I simply inserted my sim card and just like that I was connected.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone on a budget. It is truly worth the price!",

It has been fine. Screen looks good. Camera takes good pictures. No lag to speak of. Volume is a little low. The only thing I don't like is the SD card options and no double tap. I wish this had a 6\" screen.SDcard - you have to use the sdcard as internal or external memory. if you use it as external you can put the card in other devices. You can't move apps to sdcard. If you use it as internal it encrypts the card for use in just this phone and will not be readable any where else but you can move apps to sdcard.Double tap. I read somewhere that you can double tap the screen to wake it up. Not sure what version of Android this works on. I had double tap on my Windows 10 phone and I liked it. Double tap does not work on this phone. From what I have heard and read it's pretty much Stock Android.The ads on the lock screen do not bother me. I hardly even notice they are there. You can install another lock screen if you want to get rid of the ads.",

I have T-Mobile and was looking to upgrade and noticed all the smartphones were $500 or more, I said screw this I'll check Amazon for an unlocked/T-Mobile compatible phone. I saw the advertisements for this prior to PrimeDay and was so happy I did. After some research I preordered it and it shipped to me in less than two days along with an 64GB SD card that was on sale. Android 6.0 is fantastic, the bloatware is minimal, the speed is great, the storage capacity is huge, and the advertisements on the lock screen are hardly noticeable. Definitely would choose this phone again!",

I really appreciate having the best of Amazon and Google with the BLU R1 HD. The processor is slightly slower and the camera is average but I can live with that. The advertisements are not a bother either. My main complaint and reason for 4 stars is battery life. It does not hold a charge. I will charge it to 100% overnight and within10 minutes of disconnecting it the battery will drop to 90% and I'm not even using it! With average use it needs to be charged at least twice in 24 hours.All in all though this is a great phone for the price and fit my needs well.",

    "text": "This phone really blew away my expectations. I was not expecting much from a $60 smartphone, but the experience using this phone is really good. It is virtually lag-free and has very little performance issues aside from the occasional software glitch. I was really surprised at just how well this phone runs, because it is the first budget smartphone that I have used that hasn't had some sort of performance issues over time.I have been using this phone for over 2 months and have been very happy with it. As I previously mentioned performance has been excellent and I have not experienced any slow-downs over time. The software skin is very light which I think attributes to the smooth performance. The screen looks really good and I honestly have no complaints with the resolution at this size, it looks fantastic for a phone at this price point. The 16GB base storage was decent enough for my usage, but the inclusion of MicroSD was great for saving the large amounts of pictures I took using it as I took it to the beach, the zoo and basically all over the place. To be honest the rear camera quality is pretty disappointing. It doesn't take very good pictures at all which was unfortunate, because it is the only sore spot this phone really has. On the other hand the selfie camera is excellent compared to most phones even the flagship phones I have used like the iPhone 6. The addition of a front-facing flash also really helps the images.Wrapping up I have to say that this phone is definitely a recommended buy from me. It is an excellent device in nearly every way minus the poor camera performance, but that is not a huge deal breaker for me. The Amazpn included apps were pretty nice because I use a lot of Amazon services anyway and the lock-screen ads are not very distracting.",

I bough the earlier version of this guy, the one with jsut 4 gig of ram...  I could only install 3-4 apps.  The R1 HD comes with 16 gig and that's plenty for me.  The phone is snappy and responsive and does the few things I demand of it.  The screen feels like glass and looks great.  I paired it with a simple case and really could not be happier.  Does come with some Amazon apps that I wasn't able to uninstall, but that really hasn't bothered me so far.  The ads are a non-issue too.",

Very glitchy, bluetooth unusable, can't connect to anything, if it does manage to connect, it drops the device (headset) in a matter of seconds, even both are fully charged. If you are listening to streaming radio, and you receive an email notice, the audio quality of the music turns to crap, unless you pick up the phone and clear the message! JUNK!! Absolute JUNK!! Did I say it's a piece of CRAP? Yes! and that is being nice. If I could give it 0 stars, I would have. The R1 HD is meant to \"look good\" but not perform. Customer service will do everything they can to blame YOU or your headset, or some other factor to deflect their responsibility to FIX the problem. If you buy this product, you are on your own! If you are considering buying this POS, i urge you to pay a little more and buy a BRAND NAME device. #NeverBuyBLU",

    "text": "Amazon blows my mind every time... I shattered my phone into a million pieces and needed a quick replacement for the weekend due to un expected emergencies. Wasn't really expecting anything from this phone other then a bandage and possibly a back up if ever necessary again. this phone for the money is some of the best value ive ever seen. no its not the fastest or has the best screen resolution or features, the camera is decent the speaker is quiet and not crisp (this is all in comparison to lets say for example last years model smartphones averagely priced around 500-600 dollars) , but the 1GB Ram works excellent considering what normal 1gb performances I'm use to.  the android system works phenomenally and is what really sells me on this whole complete phone package and makes me consider using this as an every day device. I was whole heartedly expecting a half a.. play store experience where you couldn't download or have access to all apps. completely incorrect. all apps even complicated ones such as my Vance and Hines Programmer for my exhaust is available widgets and music apps all readily available and perform flawlessly on the phone. the phone does get hung up every now and again and has occasional lags, the battery is I would say below par but passable. and the screen is by no stretch the clearest nor is the rather quiet speaker system. but if your looking for something to excel in that category you should really be looking into a fairly new LG Samsung or HTC device. I would highly recommend this to anyone in search of an affordable android smartphone that is truly smart and not a cheap gimmic that has no droid capabilities. that really is the phones savings grace. I'm beyond impressed how well its all managed, I would say its on par as the leaders in the android department. two other small sidenotes I feel should be mentioned. the phone looks absolutely beautiful ascetically, it feels slightly light and not cheapish but more dainty but I feel has stood up fairly well to in and out of my pocket, don't get me wrong if it takes a spill it will break, but no one can say that the phone doesn't look beautiful, even the ATT lady was like dang this phone is gorgeous where'd you get this thing at and how much did it cost you,( she had a iPhone 6s by the way). my final thing is the texting. the main reason I got the phone because I needed to readily keep in contact via text. ive had many cheapy phones where the texting is atrocious and all over the place the phone cant EVER keep up and is a nightmare and usually causes me to throw said phone into the trash. not the case on this phone, not only is the texting very crisp usable precise and easily to maneuver as well as learn ins and outs, its also in my mind considered as good as the main phone manufacturers when considering all the key components such as precise key touching spell check auto correct making edits to text, inserting emoticons finding symbols and what really has impressed me far beyond anything, if your like me and horrible at touch screen texting, the talk to type in my honest opinion is far better then my LG G3 that I had previously and as good if still not better and more accurate then the HTC M8 I had before that. in conclusion both HTC and LG phones I had exceled overall and I'm sure Samsung's galaxy would more so as well, but I cant help but love the simplicity and price point of this amazon bred phone, and would highly recommend this to any smart phone user of any kind. dare I say if you didn't need the best of the best and were content with an average phone this is more then capable of being a everyday smartphone for the normal young age demographic.",

    "text": "Bought the BLU R1 HD 2GB RAM & 16GB storage w/Amazon Ads version, a 64GB microSDXC for additional storage, and a Cover w/Screen Protector for $80 on Prime Day last month.I'm testing it 'til my iPhone contract is up in a month as I wanted to get off the Verizon wallet-draining train. $200+ a month for 3 lines is too much.  I've had a 4S and a 6 since they were 1st released using the Verizon 'new every 2' plan they've since disco'd.I work in an IT-related field, but don't consider myself techy or a gadget geek, and I still prefer my laptop or PC whenever I need to do any real computing.As of right now I'm 90% satisfied and will very likely sell my iPhone 6 for whatever it's worth (w/the iPhone 7 release imminent that won't be as much as right now), which will pay for my next 2+ years of phone service!I also looked into getting Square Trade warranty...it's (a lot) more than this phone cost me new! Why bother??!!The caveats: - Camera isn't as good as iPhone or higher-end Android. I knew this from a review I read online. Not a deal-breaker for me. - It's a bit slower than iPhone (based on a couple of games I play)...but not by a lot. - Doesn't connect w/my car's Apple-enabled (ipods and iphones) deck/head unit (HU)/stereo via USB cable. I now use BlueTooth (BT) while commuting to work, and connect the USB to keep it charged on longer trips. I assume I could upgrade the deck to a Google/Android-enabled model, but not worth it as I don't spend that much time in my car. ---Tangent: Sound quality IS better thru the USB vs. BT on my iPhone, but noticed no significant quality difference between BT and the AUX input/headphone jack of the Blu R1 when connected. Not apples to apples obviously, but used for reference as I'd think any dedicated connection, be it AUX or USB, would be better?? Not so much in this case??? - Haven't figured out how to get notifications for texts, etc. to show up on the screen when the screen saver is active. I miss that from the iPhone, but probably a setting I've missed (I'm an Android n00b). - Phone calls are lesser quality, and I have to have the ear-piece volume MAXED to hear it, but I'm old(er)..... - Battery life seems fine, but haven't spent a day using it continuously and rarely do. - I'll have to re-purchase all the Apps I liked on my iPhone. But I just went thru these on my iPhone and of the dozens I have on it, I may only \"need\" to buy 2-3.So, if an iPhone is the 'standard' and rated a 10, I give this an 7+ (which equates to my 4 star rating - FWIW). If I include the cost savings than it's a 9+.My .02: If you 'live' on your phone/ do everything on it, your pictures are important and it's a 'fashion accessory' you'll want to spend more. If you want the basics of a Smart Phone w/out the cost, this will do.YMMV",

    "text": "I was very skeptical of this device at first glance - I contacted both Amazon and Blu to get more info about it and was redirected all about. My father recently cracked his S5 - a phone that\u2019s probably a bit too powerful for him, anyway. So, we pre-ordered one of these with the ads installed. Here\u2019s a run down of what you get and how it well it works:The phone comes in a nice box - basic. Manual is vague, it\u2019s a generic charging cord, and there are no other accessories. The Blu case for this phone is now on Amazon, though, so we pre-ordered that as well and it\u2019s pretty decent. This is a barebones phone. We ordered the two gigs of RAM - a must, in my opinion. Android 6.0 just won\u2019t function the way it should on less.It booted up quickly, we logged into Google and Amazon, and got to installing apps. It hasn\u2019t crashed yet, and it picked up both T-Mobile and our wifi very well. We did a few test calls, sent and received some emails, snapped a few photos, etc. It functions very well in all of these regards - no long waiting time, no crashes, and it\u2019s a speedy version of Android that forgoes things like a default web browser. (Unlike the S5.) Instead, you get Chrome.The Amazon bloatware is pretty minimal - only a few megabytes of apps that, in actuality, aren\u2019t half bad. We removed them from the home screen, along with the Amazon widget. The ads only appear on your lock screen - they\u2019re surprisingly elegant. They aren\u2019t annoying, they make you tap a specific spot twice to avoid opening them accidentally, and personally didn\u2019t mind them.IMPORTANT: You *can* remove the ads on this phone - just like a Kindle. Amazon charges you $50, making the price of the phone exactly the same as if you had bought it without them to begin with. We did so, because $110 is insanely cheap. With that said, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a deal-breaker. It\u2019s up to you. But yes, you can remove them. (Something I had to find out myself when I got the phone in because I couldn\u2019t get a straight answer on it from support.)Overall, the battery seems to be holding nice, the build quality is quite good, and it\u2019s a fast, stable phone. When my mother\u2019s S5 goes, we\u2019ll replace it with one of these as well. For everyday users that aren\u2019t avid gamers, photographers, or the like - this is a fantastic deal. I\u2019m surprised how nice the phone is.",

I'd really rate it about 4.25-4.5 because the speaker is a bit weak, and the battery may not be optimal, but for $60 it's solidly  built and certainly quick enough for my 60+ eyes and fingers.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the gorilla glass, the snappiness, and the visual quality.  The lockscreen ads are usually unobtrusive, but I check the daily deals, anyway, just for fun.

If you're looking for an inexpensive Android phone that performs well the BLU is a great deal.

The phone works well, it's stylish, pictures come out awesome! This is my 1st Android so the issue I have so far is getting used to a non-iPhone. However, I can tell you that the price difference between this and a $600-800 iPhone makes all the difference.HERE'S MY UPDATE: Like I said, I'm getting used to the Android world. I really miss the dedicated Home button that iPhones and some Androids offer. Hard getting used to looking for the much smaller and non-tactile soft-Home button of this phone. It also really bothers me since the only way to wake the phone from sleep mode is to press that one small side on/off button. Unfortunately, that side on/off button is partially covered by the silicone case I'm using (certainly not the fault of this phone) - but the lack of a Home button prevents me from using that familiar method of waking the phone. I also would have preferred the volume buttons to be placed on the left side of the phone so that I don't accidentally press them when trying to press the on/off button.",

    "text": "So if you've read this far, you likely know the basic deal with this phone.  You get a nice middle of the road android phone at a bargain price, especially if you let Amazon throw ads at you on the lock screen.  For the price this phone is solid.  And it's likely better than anything you're going to get for the price from any of the carriers.  To those points, it is exactly as advertised.So what are the flaws?  First one is the camera is very poor.  I know most people depend upon their phone as their primary camera these days.  I personally wouldn't with this one.  If you have enough light, it's \"ok\" in terms of quality.  In any amount of shade at all it gets grainy fast.The other flaw is no guest mode.  One user only.  For me this was hugely disappointing as this is my \"spare\" phone, and it's the one I would be most likely to hand to a friend to use or a kid to play games on.  But if you are logged in with your primary account, you just handed them your entire life.  Not good.If you need a burner or a cheap phone for a teenager, this one is likely fine.",

She has a kindle fire, borrows my iPad (also had a used one of her own in the past that got broken) and had an iPhone 4 without service for a couple years that she basically used like an iPod for games and music. So far, she is incredibly happy with this phone. She says it is easy to use. The screen resolution is nice, it doesn't feel or appear cheap, and I like that it comes with gorilla glass. I would consider purchasing a blu phone for myself. The biggest problem I have had is that there are not many options yet for cases and screen protectors, or the ones that do don't have the best reviews. I chose a wallet style case for her to match the one she has for her kindle. I bought the skinomi screen protector and it made the screen less sensitive to touch, so I was disappointed in that. I'm looking forward to finding more products and accessories for this phone for her. The ads aren't very intrusive, especially with the lock screen on. Her kindle also has ads, so she hasn't complained at all.",

    "text": "This is my first expedience with a my own Android phone. This phone is replacing an aging iPhone 4.First, the product support from BLU.........yep, not much there. Their trouble shooting instructions don't cover any of the issues I've encountered. These may seem trivial to some but they're annoying. I'd like the software to operate as advertised.1. Custom Ring tone, notification tones, alarm tone......each has a separate folder so if you intend to use a tone in more than a single setting you have to load a separate copy in each folder. Then you have to reboot the phone anytime you add a ring tone. Every time.2. Custom ring tones for different users.....not happening. There is an option in each contact to set a custom ring tone for that contact except it doesn't work. It only uses the default ring tone.3. Seem the Android operating system (or maybe Google, the phone is VERY Google-centric) uninstalls my browser of choice, Mozilla Firefox whenever I reboot or every time I add a ring tone.On the plus side the screen is bright and battery life is not bad. Games look good on it.The phone is running Marshmallow. Hopefully Nugat will iron out some of theses issues.UPDATED: I tried it, called BLU for assistance. Their answer to everything is to do a FACTORY RESET. Well 3 resets later and the phone is still not functioning as advertised. Returning the phone. Getting a MOTO.",

I don't believe that it gets 4g data, but it balances out with a decently long lasting battery, a good screen quality and brightness, and sensitive screen. while neither the front nor the back camera is ideal, they certainly work well enough. I bought the version with adds and it and they are not too obtrusive. the hand feel is very nice  and the phone works well. I am using it abroad , and had no trouble getting a sim card to work with/ in it. the back is a little hard to get off at first, but once you figure it out its easy.

Assuming they determine the phone is defective, they will repair or replace it at their discretion, then return it to me.

    "text": "First impressions, this smartphone is incredible. It has a great feel, very sleek and sophisticated all around.  Setting it up was easy as it's compatible with straight talk currently on the AT&T; network. I opted for the 16G model with ads and let me tell you it's a no brainer. The ads don't interfere with the integrity of the phone at all.  Its a non issue.The clarity of the calls I made was phenomenal in comparison to my LG G4 which cost 5 times what this phone cost me. I made a phone call on my g4 and had 3 dropped call attempts so was forced to finish making my call using my R1 HD. I was able to successfully complete my call to groupon's customer service (which is another review and subject in itself). Long story short, I'm glad it happened because I was able to see this phone in action. During the call I did notice one slight flaw. I toggled between handset and the phone speaker and I immediately noticed the phone's speaker is extremely small and doesn't produce enough sound to warrant using the speaker function. The sound level was disappointing but is also a non issue nor a deal breaker as there's a convenient handy dandy lil earphone jack so no worries on that regard.On another note there are too many cool features like the smart lock feature and the lighting for both the rear and front facing cameras. Pictures and videos are crisp and vivid which was the initial wow factor for me. Also the battery has lasted all day.At this point if you're considering a cost conscious phone that truly delivers and packs a punch visually and aesthetically this is worth discovering all of the cool perks. I'll be sure to follow up with this review as time passes. Nothing but good things to report so far.",

It seem of good quality and the picture and video quality was great compared to other phones plus it comes with a lot of built in space and the sound was load and clear. However by September-October the phone started giving problems. When you turn off the phone or try to restart it, It wouldn't come on, or you would feel the vibration or hear the sound when it comes on but the screen was just pitched black. It would eventually come on after a lot of tries. The few times I restarted it was because the phone freezes and once when the camera failed to load repeatedly.

It simply doesn't have nearly enough memory to function at a basic level. Over half the memory is devoted to system software. Install more than a couple simple apps and it cripples the phones ability to update software which it wants to do constantly. After each update you need to mess around with your app permissions again and again. It's frustrating!There are other problems like an inadequate speaker that can barely be heard despite being at max volume, a Damn nearly impossible to work with notification setting system that wants to be either all on or all off, low battery life and constantly dropped GPS.",

    "text": "I would give this phone 5/5 , stars.  But the invasive ads impair performance and somewhat damper the user experience of what would be an otherwise solid budget phone.  But, if you're on Prime, with the price tag at $49.99 this phone is so affordable that it practically falls into impulse buy territory.  The low cost of course is subsidized by both the cost of your Prime membership and the presence of the ads.PROS:the phone is a decent performer even with only 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage.  The screen is made of Gorilla Glass, a feature that not too long ago was reserved only for high end flagship devices fetching much steeper price tags. Other than the aforementioned Amazon ads, the phone's firmware is as close as you're going to get to pure unadulterated Android outside of the Nexus line, which is a huge benefit.  I personally have always hated the custom skins manufacturers slap on top of Android, eg; Samsung Touchwiz, HTC Sense, LG Optimus, Moto Blur, etc...  Skins rarely add any value to the device, and the things they do add come at the cost of performance and standardization.  So kudos to Blu for staying true to their roots.  Battery life is decent, the phone typically lasts me an entire day.  I do wish that it had a removable battery, but very few phones these days do, which brings me toCONS:Most phones that lack removable battery typically don't have cheap plastic removable back plates, which puts the phone at much greater risk of incurring water damage and detracts from the overall aesthetics of the phone, so that is definitely a mark in the negative column.The phone is notably missing several features found on a lot of higher end smart phones, such as front facing stereo speakers -- the R1 HD has a single prominent yet oddly placed speaker on the back.  Also, the phone lacks a fingerprint reader.  Considering they've all but become standard equipment on virtually all phones in the last two years, this may be enough for many users to turn their nose up at this device.  However, the biggest downfall of the phone is the lack of 5GHz wireless.  I this day and age, that is simply an unforgivable flaw.NEUTRAL:Interestingly, this phone has the capability of using two SIM cards simultaneously, a feature that is FAR more common overseas.  However, the dual sim feature is poorly supported here in America (try finding a service provider that will allow you to have two phone numbers on a single device without jumping through hoops).  Not only that, but Verizon/Sprint do not support this phone, so I can't really see the point since virtually all GSM networks have essentially the same coverage in the US, so the only dual sim use case that makes any sense to me is CDMA+GSM. So unless you often travel outside the US, I don't see that second sim tray doing anything but collecting dust.Also, the first unit I received had a non-functional SDCard reader, which is an absolute no-go for a device with only 8GB of storage that the user has to split with the OS.  However, in typical Amazon fashion, they replaced my phone the next day with one that had a working SDCard reader, so no harm, no foul there.In conclusion, for the price, this phone is absolutely fantastic.  But when pitted against other phones of similar vintage and specs, this device is clearly hamstrung by a lack of features and further hampered by the annoying advertisements.  This phone would have been a game changer in 2012, it's just a little late to the party.  But hey... At least its not the Amazon Fire phone... :-)",

    "text": "I need to start saying that this is one of the best smartphones you can buy tight on budget. I normally use a lot of apps and I bought this device as a backup phone, because my nexus 5X is being repaired. So far, the phone has been working great in terms of performance. It's not fast, but it's stable you just have to give it time to process some things like trying google now. I tried games like Sonic dash 2, the new mario game and pokemon go. It works like a champ. And for a phone nowadays using 2GB this one most of the time have about 500mb free which is good, it's possible to do some multitasking here for real.The cons!! and that's why i'm thinking of returning the phone.-NETWORKING!! IS HORRIBLE!I get slow performance on the WiFi, like it doesn't make any sense. Not even 10Mbps while standing next to the router. It doesn't matter much to me because as I said, this is a backup phone. But the bluetooth, oh man, I have to restart the phone because it doesn't find my devices (Skullcandy Hesh 2, Anker Soundsync and HP Sprocket) sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't. A lot of times doesn't detect the devices correctly, like a bluetooth for the car, and then I cannot speak while driving. I reset the phone and then it works. Also!! when the device is finally connected, it reconnects every 5 or 6 minutes, which is really odd. I don't know if they do it on purpose behind the hood to save battery or so, but definitely i'm not a fan.The WiFi problem continues, a lot of times it doesn't want to connect to the wifi like hardware based and I get the error that i have below at the picture. This was today, and it's been the whole day. Yesterday it was fine.But as I said. This is good for a backup phone, it's stable on performance, it really surprised me. Maybe I wasn't lucky. This can be a bug that will be addressed on updates who knows. I hope it gets better for sure, because if not. There's no point on having a phone like this as a daily driver. As least it's not gonna be me.",

    "text": "As somebody who has owned more than my share of mobile phones, this is one of my favorites. My enthusiasm might be more qualified if it was a more expensive phone. But it isn't. And at the price, I can't imagine why almost anyone wouldn't be perfectly happy with it. Nice display, good solid feel, better than reasonable performance. I liked the fact I could easily add my own SD card (I have lots of those hanging around) to bump up the unit memory, and I even like the Amazon ads and the fact that it's completely integrated with my Amazon account, but then I basically live in an Amazon technology universe.Cons (none of these deal breakers) include:* My SIM doesn't really fit cleanly into the slot, and with no instructions it took me awhile to figure out how to install it (I didn't want to yank out the metal holder and do damage to the unit).* It does not support wifi calling on my T-Mobile account, which makes it a little less useful for me since I live in area with no good cellular signals.* It's a little slow on startup when I turn the phone on.* I'm personally not a huge Android fan and sometimes feel like the phone is watching me and doing things I didn't ask it to do. I suspect I can work through some menus and figure out how to turn off some of the automatic \"features\" but I do think that iOS does a better job of giving the user more control right from the start. I'm sure Android fans would differ with my opinion.In any case, if this phone cost $200 or more, it would still be a good phone. At $50, it's kind of unbeatable.",

For the first time in my life a phone actually WORKS smoothly, great interphase, everything was easy to set up and accounts were integrated in a few seconds. My favorite thing is actually how beautiful this phone looks. I was hoping for a white version but the black looks sleek, slightly rounded glass, thin exterior, slightly heavy metal feel. Stupendous. I've noticed calls on speaker are a pain though, volume too low. This does not have an excellent camera, but with all the other features, for under $60, I just cant complain.",

    "text": "I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a phone that just works. The ads aren't too intrusive and can actually be helpful if you like Amazon Prime TV. The OS is almost \"Stock\" Android, which is a good thing. I would like to think that Amazon will keep this updated, which will be good for the longevity of the device. There is very little lag in the device. For comparison my daily driver has been a Motorola Moto X Pure Edition which is comparatively high end. This phone has been very pleasing to use on a software and hardware front. The screen is bright and crisp, but a little washed out. The phone is plastic and light without feeling cheap. It definitely doesn't feel expensive like a $500+ phone but definitely feels like $200-$250. The only down side is that there aren't many cases available. It appears to have been really popular so maybe case makers will start making them.One more thing to note is that I've noticed that in short periods I'm losing 5-10% battery. It might be my imagination or I might not be paying attention. There is nothing in the battery info that indicates it could be anything but \"wifi\" which I don't have on while I'm away from home. Time will tell, I'm sure.Update: After a couple weeks I've gotten good battery life. Good signal and all around have enjoyed the phone. I do notice a little weirdness while typing on the keyboard. I'm terrible with touchscreens so it is probably me. I wouldn't say it had to do with the phone.  I'm happy to have purchased it.",

Cheap, easy to use, has all your Amazon stuff cause you gonna download that stuff anyway. If you are already have a Android phone and need a back up/traveling phone? This is one with 2 SIM slots, can take mini SDXC cards up to 64 gb, which is all you need, the battery is not replaceable which to some is a bummer but finding some cheap phones that do is hard. And the next bummer is no upgrade to Nougat, you have to hack that up in Dev mode to do that. I recommend that you only do that only if you REALLY need that 7.0 experience. The only thing that is going to be a nick on your head is that 720p screen, but if you had nothing before, this is a welcoming look, as you can't see the pixels still till you jam your eye onto it. Really who needs a 1440p screen? At least OnePlus says that's too much and stay 1080p, so did Apple. If you are coming from a high end Apple device, may wanna stick with that longer for the social media stuff cause Android is abit lacking with integration of those apps. But you want a starting point, this is a good cheap way to try before you get in.",

They don't tell u this. Bummer. We're using it in dev & traveling to Europe, Asia and USA and for our dev work for multi-platform apps for iOS and Android. We're very happy with purchase. Just got a simple SIM card from one of those 190 country SIM cards for $9.99 that came with a $3 credit and I'm using it working from our home wifi to develop apps. Now, we can see it LIVE directly from Android Studio (GET LATEST BUILD as of 07.27.2016) builds on a REAL Android device. WoW. Great stuff.

The phones camera is probably my favorite aspect. Simple, easy and takes great pics of sunrise and sunset pics. Better than any phone I have ever had for basic pic taking, although other reviewers may disagree- I am not a professional. Amazon Prime ads are not obtrusive. More like a screensaver you can slide away if you don't like it.

    "text": "I bought this phone for my mother-in-law to replace an aging 2G device. I had it lightning fast and had it set up very quickly. I had to make it very simple, so I installed a third party launcher so I could put the icons and widgets exactly how I wanted them for her. I put in an AT&T; sim card and the device recognized that it was set to AT&T;'s network and automatically selected the correct APN file so that data and MMS would work. I didn't have to set any of it up.It feels nice in the hand and is very fluid. I didn't notice and lagging or jitters whatsoever. The pictures are nice and clear as well. I got her the version with the Amazon ads. The ads only show up on the lock screen and no place else. Swipe it away and it goes to the pin number pad. I also installed a third-party dialer since the dialpad is not shown by default when you select the phone app. Great Android device for the money! I almost hate to give it to her! LOL!",

    "text": "I had an older model BLU phone for almost a year (given to me second-hand) and I liked it so much that when it started acting up after a year (mostly due to being overworked by the work I put it through), I went looking for a newer model by the same manufacturer. So far, this phone has been wonderful - it's not a flagship phone, but it's not so cheap that it's useless either. I use my phone more than I use my laptop, so this is perfect for running several apps without slowing down, and also has quite a bit of storage space (although I added an SD card from my other phone). It's only been a month but so far, it hasn't given me any problems. My only issues are with the camera (which has pretty low quality compared to other phones) but other than that, it's been great.I'd recommend this for someone on a budget who still wants a reliable smartphone. I transfered my T-Mobile plan to this phone pretty effortlessly too.",

For instance, Benameur said, \"They can tell you launched Facebook for 10 minutes and then switched to Google Maps, and so on.\"Kryptowire discovered that the firmware can be set to sift through the data for specific phone numbers, names, or other key words, capturing and transmitting only that information.

The ringing volume isn't loud enough even when turned up to maximum volume (outside); speaker is just poor quality.

I travelled with it overseas, put an additional local SIM card. The software part of the phone, didn't seem to know what the hell was going on. I've had to remove the 2nd SIM card every time I've tried to have two cards at the same time.The Amazon ads notifications go full swing when you are moving. So at home you may get a few limited beep notifications. As soon as you get into a car start driving (with GPS location on) the beeping is endless. I get it, but please when you are driving who needs the distraction.It hangs regularly for no reason. So you have to reboot it.I'm going to have to get another phone.",

The only thing that shocked me about it it doesn't have any ringtones except one which sounds like a regular phone ring, and a pretty notification ring.

Then I started getting virus pop-ups.  I deleted a bunch of apps and ran antivirus, which found nothing.  Then calls started having trouble.  People couldn't hear me or I couldn't hear them - like at all.  Now, at 10 months, the phone rings and I can hear it but there is nothing showing on the phone to answer it.  I have no idea who is calling and I have to wait until it stops ringing for it to show in the missed call log.The moral of the story is - you get what you pay for.

The only way to clear it was to remove the battery, which was quite a feat since it is a sealed battery. I cleared the phone and now it will not power up. It completely dead and useless.  I am past my 30 days return, and am now stuck because I have broken the seal of the battery. At this point I would not recommend this phone to anyone. I had to exchange this phone for the same previous model.",

But I spoke to a representative at Amazon I was told that this particular phone was not one of the ones with a software. It's obvious that no one really knows which ones do and which ones don't. Not because of the phone but strictly because of the Chinese spyware software I would rate this phone as a \"do not buy\". I have returned ours.. Amazon was gracious enough to take the phone as well as the micro SD card that was formatted by the phone and could not be reused. Good job Amazon for returning mine but you should recall All the Rest back! If people enter passwords to bank accounts credit cards or even their Amazon account is all open the Chinese hackers.

    "text": "In short, if you need a backup phone, a travel phone, or a \"get me by until my contract phone is...\" this is the phone for you.Pok\u00e9mon Go Update: The game works great on this phone. The Battery is small, so you will not get 24hr of Pok\u00e9mon Go, but I've been getting several hours in at a time, with charges in between. An external battery would resolve any issue with that. There are currently no battery cases for this phone though. GPS is a little squarely, my trainer walks around on his own...which has unlocked many eggs, so a plus? It works fine when I'm moving, so I have no issues with it wandering around when I'm locked in a cubicle. The AR function does not seem to work with this phone, so no cute Pok\u00e9mon on my kid pictures, but if you are really playing the game, you wont be using it anyways.In Long, I am a Windows Phone User, call me a fan boy, hipster of yesteryear, or just craving for punishment, either way, I bought in to the idea of windows phone, and will always be a fan. With that said, I have had horrible luck with Windows 10 Mobile. My work requires a stable phone to be able to check emails and take support calls 24/7. Windows 10 mobile is just not there yet. So I needed a replacement phone. I'm on ATT and thought about running with a Go phone until the Note 7 comes out(I'm not a fan of spending top dollar to buy an old phone, even if its only a year old). I could not find a Go phone in the price range and quality I wanted. It wasn't until I remembered that Amazon partnered with a couple companies to make ad supported phones, so for the price I figured I'd give it a try.It arrived in two days, and to my surprise the phone that arrived was actually rather slick. Even paying full price I would have been impressed with the look and feel of this phone. Getting $50 off for ads on the lock screen was just icing on the cake.About the advertisements: They will take up the full screen, and seem to contain only items that are like or are what I've searched for on Amazon...not sure if they have a filter for searches that you'd rather not have images appear on the lock screen though. If you have other notifications on the lock screen, the ads will be very small, and have already forgotten a few times that I had ads on there.About the Function: With 2GB of ram, the phone works smoothly. I have not had spazing, or glitching. 16gb of space is alright, you can function with it. You can add a 64gb sd card to help ease the shortage of internal storage. So as long as you don't have too many apps that require themselves to be installed on the internal memory only, you should be ok.About the Camera: I use DSLRs, so quality wise, the iPhone, Lumia 1020(40+ megapixle phone), or any of the new Samsung phones do not compete with what a DSLR can do. So to be clear, I am not comparing it to a real camera. The quality of the BLU R1 HD is enough. for the price, its great quality. The Phone also has a flash on both sides of the camera, which works great for skyping.Accessories: They are slim pickings, and the only reason I'm not giving out 5 stars. I know its a relatively new phone, but I could not find any good quality cases, let alone any charging cases, and very few glass screen protectors. I ordered the one of two cases from BLU and will see how that goes.(update: the case came in, and its what it should be for what it costs. nothing special. It has enough space for the power cord and my aux cords to plug in. always hate when that's a problem with a brand new case. Its no Life Proof case, but it is way better then not having anything to protect your phone. The screen protector they give you for free is junk. It'll work if you don't care, but I do and I prefer the tempered glass protection screens)Battery Life: Battery Life is what that size of battery should be. Nothing special, but definitely nothing bad. It is not easily replaceable. it is built into the phone, and from what I've read and see, there is no wireless charging options.Duel Sim cars is a huge bonus for Traveling. I'll be able to keep my US phone going and get a local carrier where ever I am to make cheaper, more affordable data uses, calls and texts.I'll be using the phone as my primary for the next few months before I buy the Note 7 when it is released. I'll update my thoughts on it as things come up.",

I can receive text but the phone does not notify me or says received it just starts counting down the minutes. When I send a text it says sending then says now and starts counting down the minutes and the text is never sent to the person or received by the person.  blu  corp said it could be the phone and to get amazon to send me a new one, which they did and I had the same problem with this one too. I have spent hours with tracfone and blu corp techs they can't find the messaging center number or find a solution. The tech from blu corp says it my be the device itself. Has anyone else had this problem? Or have a solution? I'd like to keep the phone if I can send texts. I got the problem with the texting figured out but I still wasn't happy with the phone. When I was in my car talking through the cars Bluetooth people said it sounded like I was in a box and I could not get my text messages thru the cars Bluetooth with this phone like I could with my LG phone. It said that this phone was not set up for this. When I downloaded a game or app from Google it took over 25mins to download. I was very disappointed with this phone and I was really looking forward to having it,  from the pictures before I bought it, it looked like a iPhone but nowhere close.

    "text": "General Info - I am a very basic user and do not normally use my phones for anything extra. Just calls, messages, websites, YouTube, camera, and Maps (GPS). Prior to the purchase of this phone, I have 2 other BLU phones and another unlocked phone.  One of the big factors for purchasing this phone other than the price was for the Built-in FM Radio.  Our family uses Tracfone as a Carrier, so unlimited data is not one of our options. As a result having the radio available has always been a plus.  So obviously I am disappointing that at least on this version the radio isn't available.Otherwise, the phone works really well for what it gets used for.  The range for WiFi is good and I have had few issues in connection.  Usually it is the location that causes the problems.  Phone calls have been clear with the people I talk with can hear me fine.  The only hiccup I had was when I tried to setup the messages to also bring in my Yahoo account.  I could receive, but not send.  No big issue since this was immediately replaced with the Yahoo Mail app.  I use Maps almost every day for driving.  So far I haven't had any issues that I had on one of my previous phones with the GPS locking up.  Youtube is used frequently on this phone by my teenager (He has same phone). He has had no issues with it and loves the response time.As I have said, overall it is a good phone.  I just hope that the bulit-in-radio can be turned on as I heard that it can be.Update Nov 1 - Noticed an issue with the alarm not going off exactly on time.  Sometimes the alarm is off by a couple of minutes.  In addition near the end of the month for some odd reason the clock reset to 3 hours earlier than normal.",

You just get used to it. Youtube ads probably bother me more.I have unlimited AT&T; data, so I throw my AT&T; SIM into it and we now have a LTE hot spot for all of my devices. AT&T; disables the personal hotspot features on iPhones if you have unlimited data. This is a great feature (Hotspot). It can cast to your Chromecast with no latency. Plays high quality videos, such as youtube and netflix media without any issues.I love this phone. I may even get another one for my little brother since his birthday's coming up.

For $60, this phone can do pretty much everything that an iPhone or a samsung can do.Crisp clean display, very responsive UI and it is so sleek and lightweight - for the current price it is a steal, I am literally a steal for this price and it operates so good.

The phone is fairly fast, all of the apps work and load quickly,You can take selfies with the front facing camera using flash!!! this is great!Battery - good, survived full day without charge (see my comment in \"the bad\" section)The phone is very slim and good looking, no one believed me that I paid only $60 for itThe Bad:Camera quality is not the best, the pictures are blurry and lower quality than my current phone. While the selfie camera has flash, it does not help the qualityCharging port - I had to push the charger to the port in order to charge it. I had times when I connected the phone to charger at night and work up 8 hours later with 50% battery because the connector was weak. I am not sure if it is my phone only, or it is a design flow.Advertisements - not bad since they are only on the lock screen and the notification bar but can be annoying sometimesThe Ugly:Some of the pictures that I took using the low-quality cameraOVERALL:  this is a perfect phone for people that do not require fancy camera (kids, older individuals)",

The problems though, unfortunately, vastly outweigh the benefits. The first one I experienced is that it was displeased with my request that it change default memory to my SD card. It actually just stopped remembering anything at all. I spoke with techy friends who work for geek squad, and theirs and the Internet's solutions did note fix the issue.Ultimately, the arrow to the Achilles tendon of the R1HD is the battery. It dies at random times, deciding that 47% battery isn't enough to go on, and it defecates out and dies. I can have it charged to 100% and it's back down at 20% within 30 minutes of just sitting, not even in use.So that is where I stand. Save your money and buy a different model, I hear the Blu Vivo is good, that's what I'm going for next.",

A Blu rep posted on another review here that the source is available but upon emailing their support it seems that was a lie. It's been a month now. We were kind and waited (even though it's supposed to be made available from release) but enough is enough. You are committing software piracy. That is illegal. Release the source or face the consequences.

I have not had any dropped calls, the sound quality is good, and the phone is fast thanks to the processor. I'm considering buying another one and storing it away for when my husband can't take it anymore and decides he wants the same phone.I would say the only things I have noticed that could be improved on the phone is the headjack seems to transmit static when there is no active signal (music, phone call, etc.). I think this is a grounding issue on the jack. I have seen another comment mentioning this issue too.The speaker phone is also on the back of the phone so if you have any sort of audio you are wanting to listen to and lay your phone down with the screen facing up, it becomes pretty difficult to hear anything. I put a wallet/stand style case on mine that helps a bit because I can prop the phone up, but the audio from the speakerphone is still not as loud or clear as my old iPhone 4S.Aside from those two things, I'm very happy with this phone and I have no regrets about retiring my old apple device and making the jump to android.",

    "text": "I've had this phone for a month now. It's better than expected and the lockscreen ads don't annoy me. Mostly that's because I usually unlock my phone without looking at it. But let's break this down into pro/con.Cons:- Terrible photo quality. Overexposed and not particularly crisp. I expected this when purchasing based on other reviews. (The video quality, interestingly, seems to be better than the photo quality, but maybe that's just my amateur eye.)- Sometimes sluggish. It's not terrible and it's not constant, but sometimes there is a delay unlocking the phone or opening an app.Pros:- Price. Is there a similar phone within $100 of this? Probably. Is there a similar phone within $50? No. Is there a similar phone for $60? Ha!- Dual sim. I will never get a phone without dual sim again. (And FYI: It works well with the FreedomPop sim.)- Battery. The battery lasts all day and sometimes about a day and a half.- SD slot. The operating system takes up nearly 5GB so I added an SD card and use SD as the default write disk.If you don't use your phone for CPU intensive games or quality photography then I'm not sure you can beat this bargain.",

Sometimes the passcode page is invisible making it a challenge to get past the initial passcode. Sometimes it turns itself on and off over and over again.  There is no way to remove the battery and replace it in order to force a reboot like you can on other devices. Supposedly when you push on certain buttons it will reboot, but I have found that that doesn't work. I have to wait a few days for the battery to die and then I can charge it and turn it back on, sometimes. sometimes I have to let it die multiple times and then recharge it and restart it. If I was using it as a phone instead of a wifi device, I would be very upset. As it is I can not recommend this product. It has never been treated roughly. Its never gotten wet and never was dropped. It just sits in my house for intermittent use.I have not activated the phone and am using it on wifi because I couldn't justify using it as a phone with such bad battery life. I finally figured out I have a Defective charger. When I substituted with a different charger I charges up fine. A new product shouldn't cause such frustration. Now that it charges the battery life is a couple of days and I am cautiously considering replacing my 3 year old  flip phone with it.It is disappointing that Amazons only option in this case is to return the whole product. There is not an option to ask for replacement parts.As I am using it on wifi, I am able to text, read my email, and play my usual games. It is easy to use and responsive compared to a very slow tablet I have running on the same operating system. It needed a case because without a case it repeatedly turns on and drains the battery life faster.",

This one was no different in the way I took care of it, maybe more careful since I usually try to pay less for phones when I \"upgrade\". I had issues with the phone since I unboxed it since it wouldn't connect to my wifi. Well, I accidentally dropped the phone maybe twice, from no higher than 2 feet each time. Of course, from drops lower than 2 feet, I never expect so much as a scratch. I get very little use out of this phone since it doesn't connect to my wifi and I don't use data very much, and NOW the screen is cracked after those couple of drops from very low height. Definitely not worth the money I paid. If I could go back, I would avoid the purchase and save my money, and just wait to buy a different phone straight from my service provider. A very cheaply made $60 phone with a weak screen (Gorilla Glass my ass) owned for less than a month with no chance of staying connected to my wifi for more than an hour really is of very little use to me when I spend more time using the phone it was meant to replace. You can say I regret my purchase big time. For $60, I didn't expect a lot, but I at least expected a little better than what I got.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed in the battery life on this phone. It dies quickly with any use other than phone use, and will not charge with a standard car charger.  It says to use the charger it comes with, so it could be it requires more juice than a standard charger, but it's a problem when I can't charge it in the car.I also don't like the way it changes the screen when I'm using the phone. If I need to \"Press one\", for instance, I have to search to find my keypad in order to do it.  I like the fact that it has greater storage capacity, but the learning curve is much harder than on previous phones.If I can't solve the battery issue, I may have to return it.Update:  I've had this phone for more than a month now (just days beyond my return deadline, it turns out) and I'm really dissatisfied with it. Besides the terrible battery life, placing or ending a call can be a nightmare--especially ending one.  The screen goes away and often when I want to end a call I have to go to the home page, hit the telephone button, and answer the question about whether I want to resume the call. Only then can I end it.  I had a Kyocera Hydra Air before this one and only changed because I could get a better deal on 16 gig with this phone.I paid $59 for this phone and now can't get my money back.  I wouldn't buy this phone again.  Using it for the internet is fine, but it's a PHONE.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve owned BLU phones in the past.  They\u2019ve come a long way, but they\u2019ve never been an incredible value despite their low price point.  Their software isn\u2019t consistent between devices and they often left you wishing they just went with stock Android.When I saw the BLU R1 HD with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM for under $60, I had to give it a shot.  If nothing else it would be a good backup phone.I started really poking around and started to realize that Amazon must be seriously supplementing BLU to hit this price point, sure Amazon gets to place some ads on the phone, but that wouldn\u2019t explain everything.Let me put it this way \u2013 A $60 phone that has Dual SIM, expandable storage, the vital GSM bands (band 12 coming via an OTA update), 2GB of RAM (unseen at this price point), a front facing flash, and a decent design.  On top of that they actually pull off curved glass on this phone?  Oh, and they add a metal trim to give it a more premium feel.This is possibly the best (all things considered) phone BLU has ever made.This phone is the best phone you can get in the budget phone market.  You cannot beat it, if you are a prime member.  Non-prime members have to pay almost double to get this phone.Now take the following with a grain of salt.  Remember, this is a $60 phone.CAMERA \u2013 It\u2019s okay at best.  I gets the job done, but it\u2019s not a great camera.  It\u2019s 8MP and can record at 1080p.  Just don\u2019t expect it to match one of the flagship phones and you\u2019ll be happy.SCREEN \u2013 It looks good.  It\u2019s not amazing, but I don\u2019t find it distracting either.  The only time you\u2019ll really notice that it\u2019s not fantastic is if you put it right next to really good screen.GSM ONLY \u2013 I actually count this as a bonus, but some people really like being locked into Verizon or Sprint.  Sadly there is no option for you.  This is going to be a GSM only phone.SIZE \u2013 This is always a sore point for people.  Some people are going to say that this phone is too small, while others are going to complain it\u2019s not big enough.  I like the size.  It strikes a middle ground and it\u2019s not clunky.Overall this is an amazing phone for $60.  It\u2019s almost unbelievable.  I give this phone a big thumbs up for anyone who is looking for a backup phone or needs a good budget phone.SIDE NOTE \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen BLU push a major update.  I\u2019ve seen some security patches, but that\u2019s about it.  They claim this will someday get Nutella.  I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.  Plan on having Marshmallow for quite a while.UPDATE 1For those of you have been asking about the battery - This phone has a 2500mah battery.  That's pretty good for a phone at this price point.  A charge typically lasts an entire day for me.",

It conveniently also allows use of both the Playstore and Amazon without any effort on your part, rooting or sideloading.  The USB card seems to allow inegration with the main storage of the phone AFAI can tell with Marshamallow OS.  Screen seems nice, have not tested the camera to date.My only reason for 4 stars is that the User accounts are locked.  Lollipop and Marshallow both allow you to setup multiple users on the same device unless the manufacture locks it.  I bought this as a kids phone and would like to setup a restricted/guest account for the kids to use.  On the R1HD, this feature is locked.  Rather disappointing, this device does not allow setting up multiple users, or even a guest account.  It seems that the specs should be ample to run multiple users so it appears to be a lockout from either BLU or Amazon, not sure why really.Normally i would take off 2 stars for not having access to multiple user accounts, but with everything else you get and at the price it is still a great device, just be advised of the User account limits.I should be able to make due with an app locker for my purposes",

It's cheap, fast, and seems fairly decent quality for a sub-$100 Android phone.We bought this phone for our daughter so she could play games (and avoid damaging our more expensive iPhones).  Since the first day, we've been harping on her to be careful and not to drop the phone (so as not to break the glass).  This evening we went on a walk and placed the phone into a stroller pocket along with some sunglasses.  After the walk, we noticed that the jostling of the stroller and the sunglasses caused a large crack in the screen.  I'm not sure I should've expected *super* high quality from a $60 Android phone, but I must say that I'm fairly unimpressed that it cracked as easily as it did.",

I wanted to write this review to make sure those of you who are purchasing this, or ANY BLU phone for the dual sim feature BE WARNED!!If you have AT&T; as a carrier or and company that uses AT&T; the dual sim feature will not work. AT&T; phased out their 2G network. Although BLU phones will recognize 4G or 4G LTE in both slots, it will not do so at the same time. The secondary sim will always default to 2G. That mean you can switch between the 2 in the settings and utilize both sims but they both will not work at the same time. I called BLU customer service and they basically said sorry and recommended that I switch to T-Mobile. If other companies follow suit and phase out 2G then the dual sim feature BLU prides themselves on will be of no use to anyone. It could probably be fixed in an update but BLU are not known to update firmware all that much.If you have AT&T; the phone will still work but don't plan on making use of dual sim slots. AT&T; probably could come up with a work around but they want to force you into their phones like everyone else so don't look for them to go out of their way for you either.CONSUMER CHOICE AND FREEDOM LIMITED HERE.",

    "text": "This turned out to be a bad purchase.  The GPS can't get a consistent lock on my position, so when using any mapping app it is frequently \"rerouting\" even though I'm staying on course.  Also, the phone randomly loses the ability to make/receive calls.  I'll have full bars, but the phone will tell me the network is not available.  I then have to reboot the phone and it magically starts making calls.  Last big issue is the phone has a problem receiving text messages from iPhones.  When I get a text from an iPhone, most of the message is dropped and the little piece I do get is garbled text.  Nice price, but it can't be depended on to use as your primary phone.",

When you get a call and you also get a notification from an app, email, etc; you cannot answer the call!  The call will show up along the top band of the screen, and the notifications also show up there.  So the notifications take precedence over the incoming call and it covers it up.  You can't see who's calling and you can't click the call to answer.  It's SUPER frustrating.  I have to let the call go, and wait for the stupid notification banner to go away to finally go see what call I just missed and call them back.  It's a stupid thing that the manufacturer really needs to fix.  A cell phone should at the very least allow you to receive calls!2.  The location of the volume is not ideal; it's right where you would normally hold the phone so the volume is constantly being turned up or down.  The volume itself is not really loud as well; the alarm is not loud enough to wake me up (I usually use my cell phone as an alarm clock).Everything else is wonderful.  It's a nice phone and works very well with the exception of missing incoming calls when you are getting any sort of notification (which can include things from the phone/amazon).",

    "text": "After a full day's use of this phone, here are my pro's and con's:Pros:Excellent screen with decent viewing angles and decent in bright sun. Screen touch sensitivity is very good. Size is very good.UI is good (identical to all Androids), very little lag,Battery life appears solid, but not as good as my Lumia 640, ZTE ZMAX2, and Moto G 3rd gen.Amazon ads are really not a problem as they can be moved off the home screen. They can also be permanently deleted.Speaker volume/quality is BAD. Seriously, why did they cripple this phone with a speaker this weak? If in a very quite environment, it's ok. Speaker phone is also low volume. What a shame.Camera is a big letdown. I snapped some images of flowers, landscapes, street, and people. I sent the images to my pc, viewed full screen and they are junk. The colors are off, detail is mush, and forget shooting indoors even with good light. I tried 2 different camera apps and they both failed to save this camera. Seriously, in comparing images to a Moto E if had, the Moto images hold more detail with correct colors and white balance. Most sub $100. smartphone cameras capture better images. If you want decent images, pass on this phone.Verdict: the two most important features for me are call quality (sales rep and on the phone a lot) and a good camera...this phone fails both. As a comparison, the Lumia 640 (priced from $25-$50.) crushes this Blu for call quality with plenty of volume, and it's camera does a much better job (it's on par with the iPhone 5S). If you can live with poor speaker quality and soft/smeary images, get it as the screen is a beauty. I'm sending mine back as it's just to much of a compromise.UPDATE: bought another and it has the same crappy speaker! Then I read where Blu phones have been security compromised! Here:  [...]Here: [...]Blu has know about this since early 2015 and has done nothing! Why is Amazon even letting them sell these devices? Oh sorry, it's all about the $$$.",

Even basic apps didn't load correctly so they could be used. For example, my Starbucks app which has always worked perfectly, cannot be successfully loaded to this phone. I went back and forth between Google Play and the Amazon Apps, downloading the app and deleting, and reloading it. After many unsuccessful attempts, I gave up. I reasoned that if a common app such as Starbucks won't work, other apps may not work as well. I hope you have better luck than I did. The Amazon ads seemed very intrusive as well and not very attractive. I don't like picking up my phone and looking at an advertisement for a toothbrush.",

    "text": "Bought this for Android app development and was surprised to find that it's a good overall smartphone. Hardware specs are good enough for completely smooth operation without UI stutter, and day-to-day usage feels no different than that of any flagship Android phone. Software is mostly vanilla Android with little to no UI tweaks or bloatware, which is a massive advantage over most other smartphones. All games that I tried run perfectly well with no dips in frame rate (although I haven't yet tried any demanding 3D games). The display is good irrespective of the price and is great at $60. The rear camera is decent but not very good in low-light conditions; the front-facing camera is adequate\u2014not great, but not terrible. The rear speaker is somewhat quiet and relatively tinny but is otherwise functional\u2014it's not great and it won't fill a room with sound like an iPhone or a flagship Android phone, but it's adequate for watching videos without headphones in a quiet room, and it doesn't sound muddy or totally distorted like the speakers on inexpensive electronics tend to. The vibrating motor in this phone is somewhat mediocre and isn't very good at low-duration pulses (below 25 ms or so), but it performs as expected for anything above that, so this is probably nitpicking. In terms of design and construction, this phone looks and feels higher quality than expected\u2014Gorilla Glass 3 with curved edges, aluminum sides, recessed buttons, simple design, relatively thin profile, etc.It's worth noting that the R1 HD features an SD card slot and two SIM card slots, things which can be difficult to find in more expensive devices.For the price, this is a good smartphone overall, and I can see it putting a small dent in the sales of more expensive phones which cost upwards of five times as much and yet offer more or less the same experience in day-to-day usage (albeit with better cameras and a better rear speaker). Buy the 2GB/$60 version and not the 1GB $50 version\u2014it's a small difference in price for a large difference in performance.Screen: ASoftware: ACPU/hardware specs: ADesign, materials, construction: ABattery life: ARear camera: BFront-facing (selfie) camera: CRear speaker: C+ phone looks and feels reasonably high quality+ display is excellent+ rootable+ ads aren't at all intrusive if you don't want to root; only appear on lock screen and can easily be ignored+ has an SD card slot, something not found on many flagships+ has two SIM card slots, something not found on many smartphones here in the US+ vanilla Android!+ has an accelerometer, contrary to what another reviewer said (not to be confused with the gyroscope)- doesn't have a gyroscope, which means you have to play Pokemon Go with the VR setting disabled (who plays with it on, anyway?)- vibrating motor feels and sounds cheap- rear speaker sounds quite tinny and is between 50% and 75% as loud as my iPhone's speaker\u2014it's the weakest part of this phone in my opinion, but it's still adequateMy guess is that the next step up in terms of quality for Android phones is the Moto G (and there's a Prime discounted version of that, too), although it'll run you about $180 at the time of this review.",

    "text": "Its a fast phone, you can use a lot of apps and the ads aren't even that annoying (I have never accidentally clicked on them or anything).I had some other cheap phones that were very slow and this is a great relief by comparison.The one problem I have is that the headphone jack emits a loud and painful sound to anyone I call when I used a wired headpiece.  If i switch headsets, the sound may stop but people will state that they still hear light static in the background.  I returned the phone (thinking that perhaps it was defective) and got a replacement.  The replacement exhibits the same symptoms.  These headsets worked fine on the cheaper (and painfully slower) Blu phone that i had purchased from a best buy.  So now I am at a crossroads, use this phone where i have to hold it to my ear the entire conversation?  Or use the phone that takes 10 seconds to stop freezing after each action.Trying to find a decent budget phone that i can use without freezing as well as make phone calls on has been a total disaster.  Granted this isn't some huge problem, it certainly is annoying.  I called Blu and they said i had to make sure i was using a Blu compatible headset.  I think to myself \"Really?!? I have to find a headset that fits your phones specifications?\"  Its a basic plug in 3.5mm headset... it should work on any phone that has a jack.  I shouldnt have to adjust to fit your phones specifications (especially when the headsets work just fine on other model phones).  Getting a decent phone should not be this big of an ordeal.Additionally, the aux jack for my car doesnt work well on it either.  So theres half the functionality of my phone ruined because of the headphone jack.  I cant listen to music while driving and I cant make phone calls without holding it up to my ear the entire time.The most baffling part of this is no one else seems to be having this problem so now i just feel like im the only one that is running into this.",

    "text": "Update 2017: I mentioned other Blu phone having a malware in my July review below and i took heat for it. Looks like I was right. That said this still works. I only did that one update a while back. Unlike my old Blu where I had Chinese apps constantly getting on phone, none here but then again, the issue with this particular phone data mining. I don't get ads in this phone or unwanted texts but I also keep blocking that software update app. Not sure if it helps like in the old phone. Is it worth it? Only if you don't use your real info and people's real names in your stored contact.Original review: I currently have a blu phone which I've had since may 2015 and wrote a review on it back offering how it compared to my samsung  galaxy duos that died abruptly. The goal was to get a temporary cheap phone and I never went back.What's In the Box: phone with battery already inserted, usb and charger. Small quick guide. See pix below. Last 2 pictures are my current BLU phone which is smaller.THE GOOD:It's a bigger screen, slightly thinner and a tad lighter.The camera quality is better than the what I currently have. pictures of my old phone uploaded below where taken with this phone and pictures of this were taken with my old phone.The USB cable snaps into the phone a LOT better. In terms of how long the charger will last? I'm not sure. My last one died after about 4 months.4G LTE, I actually get that with this versus H+ with my current blu star.DUAL SIM: I like for international travels and I've a different service for business. Works well on T-Mobile networks.It's an unlocked phone. No Spyware: my current BLU phones have \"software update\" which malwarebytes has labeled a malware. I've also researched the issue and I've come across people in forums who have the same issue. I've seen 2 reviews on amazon where it's mentioned. This phone does NOT have that, so big plus.Easy connection to home wifi and my cheap bluetooth I just bought on amazon.TOTAL memory 1.9GBInternal storage: 11.1GB. I have the 16GB phone. Apps take 5.9 so if you buy the 8gb phone, you're left with 2. My current phone is 4gb and I've 2.4 free so these apps take a lot of space. I'll highly recommend the 16gb version.The Not so Good:NO Earphones! Most phones include this.NO protective case or screen protector. If you've bought Blu phones in the past, this is a heads up as Blu phones come with these extras.The charger gets HOT quite early into charging.Need to know:Speaker isn't great but it's OK. I've no issues with it. it's located in the back, fyi.MICRO SIM ONLY: not a problem for me but if you currently use a nano or regular SIM, this is just a heads up.  Inserting the SIM and keeping it still while you slide the metal back takes a bit of finesse. To open the SIM slot, use your fingernail to slide the metal in the direction of the arrow that says open. DO NOT PRY it open. The instruction is very vague and the picture makes it seem you pry it open.Ringtones: you can't use mp3 as ringtones on this phone. *using your mp3 files for personalized ringtones. I'll miss this feature along with the radio and sound recorder.You don't need a prime account to use. Ads are not an issue. You can swype right to move the widget on the second screen out of sight.Battery life is very good. Apps so far have worked very well.Keyboard has Swype capabilities.YOU can buy the case and screen protector for 6.99 here.If you own a Blu advance or star is this worth the upgrade? Only if you need more space for apps and you don't mind giving up certain apps and the accessories. If I didn't need to pass my phone down to my mom, I wouldn't get this.If you are not a prime member is this worth what you'll pay? Take a look at the blu energy x2 here on Amazon. For the same price, you get the same specs minus the Amazon ads and apps AND you get the usual Blu accessories and they have some good blu apps.Overall, considering the price I paid for these features, it is a very good deal for prime members. (an upgrade from 'good' in original review)final verdict: First thanks to the blu rep for answering my questions and addressing my concerns. I've inserted updates above where needed above. I'm updating my rating from 3 to 4. I did the wireless update and my phone is working as it was. No bad effect. I'll dearly miss some of blu apps , But i'll keep this. If anything changes, i'll come update.Thanks for reading.",

It is fast, works with most of the apps I downloaded onto it, and I didn't encounter any huge technical difficulties. If you had asked me yesterday, I would have definitely recommended it.After today, however, I cannot even come close to saying that.This phone was advertised as having \"Gorilla Glass 3\" to protect it from \"scratches, cracks, and breakage.\" This so-called \"Gorilla Glass\" does nothing to protect it. Not even two weeks after getting it, I accidentally dropped it 3 inches from the ground. The top of the screen shattered. If this brand new phone cannot even survive a 3-inch drop, I just can't see how any Blu product could have anything resembling \"quality.\" To say that this was a major disappointment would be an understatement.Yes, the phone still works, and the cracks don't obscure the screen too much, but this is ridiculous. The phone is more fragile than paper-thin china. I really wanted this to be a phone that I would keep for years. Now, I doubt that it will last through the rest of the month.",

I put in a ATT and T-Mobile sim at the same time and those work too. I still have more testing to do. See my pics that show the 64gb card works. The Amazon ads aren't too bad, but it made the phone cheaper and that's what counts.Update 07/28/16: I am now using a freedompop gsm sim which took a bit of settings and switching sim slots to get it working properly. I tried a Samsung 64GB EVO Select micro sd and it doesn't really work, took several minutes to format and showed a message that my sd card was \"slow\". The 64GB Sandisk card works fine with no errors. Hopefully firmware can make the Samsung cards more compatible.Info on FreedomPop: I was new to FreedomPop but it does work on BLU R1 HD.First you need the GSM sim version. Freedom pop is a voip service so it runs through their app. You have to download the app to use the service. Put in sim. Then go to cellular setting and add new APN. Set as follows:Name: FREEDOMPOP [This is optional, you can really put anything here]APN: freedompop.foggmobile.comAPN Type: default and dunMCC: 234MNC: 20IP Protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4Bearer: UnspecifiedMVNO type: noneSet roaming to on or it will not work. I started with the sim in slot one, but had problems with calls, then with GSM data. I then put it in slot 2 and it is working fine.",

I was worried about the camera, but it's not so bad for what I really use it for which is snapping equipment pics, model info, serials, etc.  It is a bit far-sighted vs the nexus5, I sometimes used the nexus5 camera as a magnifying glass to see stuff I couldn't make out, like numbers on a bluetooth device, etc.  It's a bit more responsive than my nexus5.  There is no compass or gyroscope, so you'll need to learn how to orient via the sun, etc.  There is no qi charging but I never got that to work reliably on the nexus5 anyway.  I don't think cyanogenmod is worked out yet for this device, but I heard it is in the works as of 161020.I love these cheap phones.  I think I paid more for the CASE that my iphone 3gs went in.  And $650 for the new pixel?  I think I'll hold out for a while and see if they put out something closer to the pricing of the original nexus5.  This blu r1 hd can always be used as a backup phone if I upgrade.170103 update:  phone is still working.  The camera sucks for close up shots like serial numbers, etc, it just won't focus.  I had to go through the firmware to make sure the Chinese malware was gone, thanks for that Amazon.170321 update:  gave up and fixed my old nexus 5.  Much better camera than the blu r1 hd.  I couldn't encrypt the blu or install cm/lineage os.  The blu seems well built, the back cover comes off easily with a thumbnail to access the internals.  I just wish they used a better camera.

    "text": "Good screen resolution, nice build and the fact that it's running Marshmallow is a big bonus (for instance, your SD can act as an extension of the phones ROM!!!) However, it also seems I got what I paid for too - after a few hours of use, the screen refuses to register taps and scrolls. Sometimes it will not respond to tapping or it will register a scroll as a tap and highlight a bunch of text. It's annoying! I've ran all the updates pending, factory reset it, tried using it with or without SD card... and I can't find anyone else complaining about this in a forum somewhere so I am left to assume that I got a defective unit. As always, Amazon is cool about replacing so I will leave this at 3 stars until I get and test the replacement unit. Overall, I'm disappointed but hopeful.Update 9/15/06: I got the replacement, changed developer settings so that GPU handles gestures, and there was some improvement but it didn't eliminate issue. A cnet review mentions lagginess but doesn't go into detail so I don't know if they were talking about the same issue I'm having. Bottom line, I shouldn't have to fiddle with developer setting to get any phone to act right. Furthermore, the battery on this phone drains fast. I means FAST. 90% of the activity on my unit is making calls, browsing using Chrome and chatting on WhatsApp - no games, no youtube. From a full charge, it'll be down to about 15% by mid afternoon, and charging it back up is a slow. So, unfortunately, I'm amending my rating to two stars. This is my second BLU phone and I'm pretty much calling it - I'm not buying from them again. You do get what you pay for and in this instance, I'm unsure the low price is worth all the compromises.",

The graphics are great, and the phone is pretty fast, and the battery life is awesome. Cons would be that things are just a little... off. The led notification light will be green or red somewhat randomly, the clock is sometimes 10-40 minutes behind, notifications don't always pop up, stuff like that. The phone itself is also pretty flimsy. Nothing too major, and like I said, for the price it didn't really bother me, but once I was able to get a more permanent upgrade I did.I'm going to keep it in case I need a replacement phone in the future, but for every day use I definitely prefer a nicer phone. The ads aren't really noticeable when you have a lock screen notification (I had a permanent one with weather underground).",

Lock screen offers are nice and not obtrusive, and we even purchased something from them! To be honest, I'm very impressed, and the phone looks and works great. I mean its basically very similar to my MUCH more expensive Samsung S5 (except a few features). I realize the S5 is a two year old phone, but i use it as my everyday phone... I could easily see myself using this phone for what i need it for (email, messaging, and phone! with some web browsing and some facebook); but with me and my prime membership and the offers it might become an expensive proposition! :)",

I wish my iphone could do this.I was able to activate a European/russian sim card, and a rogers card from the UK, as well as my at&t; and tmobile cards (tmobile offers free data overseas)It was able to handle my 64gb sd card without any issues.Google play store is open, meaning I can access my main apps I paid for from my s7 edge phone.Camera is better than ok, not the best but really good for general use, beats most amazon device cameras so far.Video options are only 710, 1080, or 480Pictures photos (see video review) they are sharp mode, meaning it adds sharpness to the already good photo.As far as games, I still have any slow down issues, games were smooth and responsibe.even though the bench marks are515 SINCLE CORE1562 MULTI COREIT is abue the same as a Sony Experia Z and Asus NExus 7 tablet, so it still holds up.NOtice all android smartphones slow down when updating or installing apps.I love watching Time Warcner Cable at home, use it as an extra tiny monitor, also like listening to Sirius XM radio.Battery life is just like any smartphone, no difference here (use it too much it drains, leave it alone it keeps up)911 - yup even without any service this phone can be used to make emergency calls so thats an extra bonus for me.ADS:I like them, sometimes I\u2019ll get offers I really like, and it notifies of me great deals.  Im sure they\u2019ll be a root for it to remove in the future,.Pokemon go:Some issues I have is that it cant orient which way Im facing, so I put the catchmode in AR mode, otherwise it\u2019s hard to see the pokemon with the camera.  Gps works fine.Overall its hard to find any faults for a device at this offering with so many features, access to free premium games from amazon underground, access to Google Play store, able to install outside applications, camera is fair to actually good.  Only con would be if you enable security mode, you have to enter a pattern or code, no fingerprint unlock which is fine.Compared to apples Ipod touch offering, this byfar beats it.Can work without sim cards as well, and for amazon underground prime account isn't needed.Very happy with it.",

This means if your non-data SIM is AT&T; it will not function with this phone.  So I have a 3-4 month old phone, and 2 AT&T; SIMs, and what worked when I purchased it no longer works in this new year.There are lots of carriers that support 2G even today, so the phone is not technically obsolete as dual SIM phone. However, I would have appreciated some warning about the 2G issue.So buyer beware, being limited to 2G for the non-data SIM may impact you if you are on AT&T;, and possibly with other carriers.",

No problems, calls went through just fine and so did messages. But as I hit the one month Mark I'm starting to have issues. Phone is slowing down, battery really only holds an 85% charge and it freezes up time to time. BUT! I only spent about $70 to get this phone so I can't really get to upset. It's like buying a Honda and expecting a Ferrari. So if you need a quick fix to a broken phone or just a burner phone it's perfect. Would not recommend for a permanent phone. ALSO IT DOES NOT TAKE MAJOR NETWORKS! SPRINT, VERIZON, AND AT&T; WILL NOT WORK!T-MOBILE does work though!! Hope this helps everyone!",

    "text": "I am a bit of a smart phone addict and I couldn't resist seeing what a $60 smart phone looked like so I ordered the 16GB version and it arrived a week ago. Over the past 24 months I have had a Nexus 5, Note 4,  Moto G, LG G4, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nextbit Robin, LG G5 and the Blu R1HD. I had low expectations for the R1 despite the mostly positive reviews so when I pulled it from the box I was surprised how solid the build was and even more impressed with the rolled edges of the screen. The back is almost as grippy as the 5X and has a nice matte finish and it doesn't creak, pop or flex like the plastic back cover of other phones. The power and volume buttons have a quality feel to them, but having the power button below the volume rocker is taking awhile to get used to. The matte finished metal trim around the egde feels nice and seems to be durable and the phone is very comfortable to hold.The screen resolution is very good and max brightness will allow you to use it outdoors in direct sunlight  with no problems. Its definitely the best 720 screen I have ever seen.  Battery should get most people through a full days use. Call reception has been good and no one I have talked to has noticed I am using a different phone. Signal strength has been excellent, but I am in a great area for T-mobile. At home I average 80Mbps up and 25 down which is similar to the other devices. Bluetooth has worked flawlessly with my Pebble Time and there have been no problems with wifi reception. The back mounted speaker is the only complaint I have. It sounds okay, but max volume could definitely be higher.The cameras are better than I expected for a $60 phone and the front flash is a nice feature for those that like to take selfies.More surprises for a $60 phone were the dual SIM trays, it runs on Marshmallow and its always nice to have expandable storage. The ads are a very minor inconvenience and amount to nothing more than a tiny ad on the lock screen each time you turn on the screen that can be swiped away in a fraction of a second.The speed of this phone is so good that one morning I was thinking I was using my 5X, but was on the R1.This phone is so good that after a full week of use I have not had the urge to pull my G5 or 5X out. Granted if I was going to take some important photos I wouldn't use the R1, but those situations don't happen daily for me so it hasn't been an issue.  IMHO there is nothing that comes close to this phone for even double or triple the price and I honestly thought I would be disappointed and return it, but its a keeper.  It will be used for a backup phone for me or one of my kids or a friend that needs one in an emergency.I paid full price for this phone and have received nothing in return for this review.  Its simply that good!",

    "text": "I tend to get older model phones to save money as I am not overly worried about having the best devices cause I am kind of rough on them and I just don't think I need them. My last phone that broke last week somewhat unexpectedly was a Samsung Galaxy S4-mini (paid about $130 in 2015, I believe 3 generations old now) which was fine for me but had a failed charging port that just kept getting worse until it no longer worked at all. THIS phone however, outperforms it every way, even the camera which is not as clear as like the high end phones coming out, still has better pictures than they older \"name brand phones\" like my S4. The functions all operate extremely fast and as a test of battery life (which was a major downside of my last phone), I only lost about 12% over night when the phone was not in use (about 10 hours) which I was pretty content with. The picture on the display is very crisp and the Amazon advertising is actually a lot less disruptive or annoying than I anticipated when I bought the phone. The only real intrusion is it rotates ad's on the lock screen before you swipe to access the home screen. No pop-ups or excessive start-up apps while you are using the phone's functions. For the money, i feel it is probably the best phone currently available. If you aren't worried about having the Top of the line telecommunication status symbol, you just broke your old phone and are light on cash, or just love getting a good value for your money - I would buy this phone and be pleasantly surprised.",

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get support from Amazon, as I cancelled the order and asked for a refund as I paid one day delivery and the item took 3 days to be delivered. By the second day I cancelled the order but I still got the phone =/. This left me without support from Amazon obviously. Sadly the phone cannot be restored as it denies any updates as it detects that it has been rooted... rooted by it's own software update :(",

I purchased the 16GB w/special offers version.I will be honest with you, I didn't expect much from this phone.I bought it planning to root it and get rid of the preinstalled Amazon apps. But the reality is the Amazon installed apps don't take much space. Less than 50 meg all told. The lock screen ads are very unobtrusive. The processor isn't amazing but it is suitabley speedy to play Pokemon GO (AR doesn't work well with the gyroscopes for some reason). It has enough RAM to run several apps simultaneously. The phone is very thin, if that kind of thing matters to you. It also has 2 SIM card slots so if you travel internationally or have both a business and a personal line this will be super for you.The bad side. The big screen eats battery life, and this super-thin phone does not have a lot of battery. Also that battery doesn't look easy to remove, so no switching batteries. Using a cigarette lighter to USB charger only charges the phone when the screen is off. And the phone doesn't charge quickly.The built in speaker is not loud. I had to sideload an app to use the built in FM radio. But overall it's a great phone, for the money, emphasis on \"for the money.\"But its pretty breakable.",

    "text": "I was quite hopeful about this phone.  I had gotten a larger, more expensive BLU Model for a family member a few months ago and except for a few odd quirks (downloadable ringtones wouldn't work) it was working great.  The set-up on the R1 HD was easy and all apps and contacts transferred from my old phone with no issues. As another reviewer pointed out having the on/off switch under the volume controls is a little unusual but not a deal breaker.  Installing the SIM card also works differently than any of the other 8-10 phones I've used over the years.HOWEVER the 1st time I tried to make a call the big issue surfaced.  The headset speaker or microphone would not work on a phone call.  No one could hear me nor could I hear them.  Using the speakerphone or a Bluetooth earphone worked perfectly fine.  I know it wasn't the speaker itself since music would play thru the speaker. BLU is only open for support M-F so I sent off a support request yesterday.  They responded the next day with instructions to do a factory reset and wipe out all data.  This seemed like an odd fix attempt given the issue but I did it.  Wiped out hours of work setting up apps and tweaking settings.  The factory reset didn't fix the issue.  Rather than continue to troubleshoot a brand-new, defective unit, it is unfortunately going back to Amazon.",

    "text": "I bought the 8GB version of this phone since the specs were very decent and the price as an Amazon Prime member made it very reasonable. The price was very cheap due to having Amazon ads on the lock screen. This phone will be used by my dad and will be perfect for him since he mainly uses it to watch videos and play games that are not very resource intensive.Right out of the box we have the following items:- BLU R1 HD smartphone- Micro USB data/charger cable- Wall charger/adapter- Instruction manualThe BLU R1 HD comes with Google Android 6.0 Marshmallow installed already which is a huge plus since I have seen a lot of the lower end phones with an older version of the Android OS installed with no pre-determined future update. Once unpacked and the screen cover was removed, I immediately powered it up and started charging the phone. I went through the quick setup wizard where it asks you for the language, name, Wi-Fi, etc. One extra item that was different was there was an additional prompt at the last step where it asks if you want to sign in to Amazon as well since they have a bunch of Amazon apps pre-loaded on this phone. You may skip it if you don't plan on using any of the Amazon apps. Once the phone was in the main screen, I went to check for any system updates and there was a small 15MB update. I went along with the install which took about 5 minutes so the phone is fully up-to-date at this moment.The phone is very smooth so far after using it for a short while now. I experienced absolutely no lags and for a phone with only 1GB of RAM, this is very impressive. The phone lists the total memory at 0.90GB with 598MB currently being used and 326MB free. The storage after several Google apps were updated was listed at 4.57GB used and 3.43GB available. This is not a lot of space but should be sufficient for the average user who doesn't download songs and movies onto their phone. If storage space is an issue, you can always insert a micro SD card (up to 64GB is supported).There is a random Amazon ad that shows up every time you unlock your phone but it's so unobtrusive that I don't even mind that it's there. A simple swipe will make it go away. Plus if you get any notifications, there won't even be an ad at all. It will show a small banner along with your notification instead.The pictures taken were pretty good and is fine for normal users. I say it's still good for family vacation pictures even unless you really are picky and need those high resolution pictures.The speakers were pretty loud and clear when I played through some YouTube videos. The position it's in (near the bottom of the phone in the back) might be a bad choice because several times my finger was blocker the speaker area and I couldn't hear any sounds. This will especially be a problem for those who plays games in landscape view.The size and weight of this phone is basically perfect for most people. It fits very comfortably in my hand, is very thin and lightweight. Not to the extent that it feels cheap either.This phone has dual sim slots so you can put in a second sim card if you travel internationally a lot and don't want to continuously swap out the sim card. There is a small opening on the bottom left corner of the phone where it makes it much easier for you to just slowly lift the back cover off. I remember most phones where you had to stick either your fingernail or a small card to make an opening.This is a great buy overall and I wouldn't hesitate to get this phone again for someone who doesn't need a high end phone.If you find my review helpful, please click on the Yes button.",

As a Result, I had choose between listening to my music peak and crackle; or listening to white noise.If you just want a super cheap smartphone, this is a great bargain, but if you listen to a lot of music stay away from this phone.",

    "text": "It doesn't indicate it anywhere in this listing-but the phone requires a microSim.  If you have a regular sim you'll have to contact your carrier and get them to send a microSim.  Then you have to contact your carrier once it arrives and have them transfer the number to the new microSim.  For me this was an extra $25 + tax.  So if you're looking for a deal but have a regular sized SIM card it's going to cost more than advertised.  I've poked around the phone and it seems solid enough.  Hopefully I can give a more detailed review once my microSim arrives.  Until then 2 stars for not being clear on what the phone required, the additional expense and the delay of use while I wait for a secondary component arrive to make it functional.",

    "text": "Bought it due to my old phone starting to fail.For the price, I'm really impressed.  The apps are easily installed thanks to the Android system, and it accepted my sim card {Cricket Wireless} with no hassle.Of course, it's a matter of adjusting from what you were used to with your old phone to the new one.For one, battery seems to drain fairly easily from a full charge.  A full five percent after taking it off of the charger for about 10 minutes minimal use.I also can't create folders in the gallery for my photos like before...so every picture I had on my SD card is not available through it.  Thankfully I saved to Dropbox.  At times, it also seems to lag with certain apps.  And it heats up a good deal during heavy use.Also, it must be said that while the phone arrived undamaged, the box it was shipped in from Amazon had absolutely no protection inside.  It was clearly evident from the moment I picked it up.  A large box, with the Blu phone box, and no filler to protect it from being tossed around?  Amazon should know better.Aside from the general grievances listed, the phone is really good for the price.  No damage, as I've previously stated.  Phone case should arrive today.  For reference, if you have a Kindle charger, it works great with this phone.",

    "text": "I rarely 1-star products unless they are simply an epic fail at the basics... like working as advertised. This is a well-deserved slam, in my opinion.1) 30-minutes of inserting, re-inserting and rebooting the phone before it recognized the SIM. When it finally worked, I had actually rebooted 3 consecutive times, WITHOUT removing the SIM.2) The SD Slot fails to work.  According to online searches, this is a long-standing issue with Blu products going back to at least 2013 and across a plethora of models... and that was just on the FIRST page of results in my search to find a solution.  My phone fails to read any empty SD... in fact, it doesn't even see it in the slot. It reads the card from my Samsung Galaxy S4 as \"Corrupted\" and wants me to format it.ALL SD cards are either SanDisk or Kingston and they ALL WORK in every single other device in which I tested them, which includes both with and without the adapter. Devices include other cell phones, Samsung Tab 8, Amazon Fire HD 8, Roku 3, HP laptop, and HP desktop. I also tested them with a number of old and new USB Card Readers, and they ALL WORKED.It's a pretty phone. The screen is gorgeous. However, when I can't intuitive figure out something and there's zero supplied or online documentation, then I take issue.When I see the same issue with all of a company's products, for years, then I not only take issue, but have to believe that the company, regardless of Mantra, does not truly care about what kind of product they manufacture... otherwise, they wouldn't still have the same issue, across product lines, for at least 4 years running.Also, when I see solutions that include \"slipping a piece of business card behind the SIM Card\", then I can only surmise that there was ZERO Quality Control for anyone to even come up with that solution... meaning, devices went out that had that much give/play to even allow a business card to slide in there to provide a \"tighter fit.\" That's simply ridiculous, not to mention dangerous considering how hot cell phones can get and the reports of lithium batteries combusting because of the phones running so hot.Until the issue is resolved, this product is a No-Go at THIS STATION.Hopefully, this is not everyone's experience, but for those others who have tons of unresolved issues and unanswered questions, I can only advise that you return this phone post haste and chose another manufacturer that (hopefully) fixes hardware and software issues within the model year, instead of letting them creep like crabgrass throughout their entire product line year in and year out.Update: 23MAY2017 - The newest version of this phone recently came out with double the internal memory... Which helps with the pitiful memory allocation that's made even worse by the bloatware that's loaded on these phones that you can't permanently remove. I can't update the phone because there's no memory, yet I've deleted nearly everything that I put on the phone... Which is about all that I use.There's no reason this phone couldn't have had the internal memory that they've given the \"new\" model. Typical cell phone company product sales tactic.Now it's eating up my data with system updates every few days. Ridiculous!So slow that it's pathetic.",

    "text": "I bought the 8GB version to use as a \"burner\" phone for travel in areas of Eastern Europe where I was concerned about electronic security, and I did not want to bring my expensive iphone with all of my personal information and credit cards on there.  This phone worked great, far better than I expected.  It is responsive, and the display is great.  I spent some time setting it up before the trip, including creating a new temporary email account, and forwarding my real emails to that account, and adding the apps that I use the most.  This was the only electronic device I used during my two-week trip, and it performed pretty much flawlessly.Some notes and suggestions if you want to buy this phone:1. 8 GB RAM is not enough, as the OS takes up a good chunk of that.  I bought a 32GB micro SD Card on Amazon, so I would not have any memory issues and also because I wanted to put lots of music on it for listening while traveling.2.  I was concerned about battery usage based on reading some of the reviews.  I never ran out of battery in one day.  But after the first few days, when saw the battery levels dropping more than I had hoped, I turned off wifi and location services most of the time, and that improved battery life significantly.  I put on a free battery app that gave me the battery percentage on the top of the home screen.3.  It takes good photos, especially considering the price.  I am a photographer,and I took a good camera with me, but I used this at times when it was just more convenient.  I was surprised how good the photos are.4.  There are ads, both on the lock screen and the home screen, but you can easily move the widget for the large ad on the home screen to another screen that you never use.  So the only ads I saw were the small one on the lock screen, easily ignored.5.  I thought that I would have to sign into my Amazon account to use the phone.  I did not want to do that because my credit card is attached to that account.  I was delighted to find that I did not have to sign in.  Sure, it gave me reminders periodically, but I just ignored them.6.  For travel I normally take my iphone and a 7-inch ipad.  I am a bit of a news junkie and I read the news every day on my ipad.  I was pleasanty surprised to find that the screen is plenty big enough to read news and other articles.7.  For the price, the phone was way more responsive and reliable than I expected.8.  I purchased SIM cards and had absolutely no problems using them.If you are looking for a good but cheap travel phone, this is a steal -- it will give you incredible bang for your buck.  I thought I would toss it after this trip, but because it is so good I will keep using it.  HIghly recommended!",

I am stuck with it and will use it as a backup if need be.

I removed my sim to do something with my old phone and couldn't get it to work again. I asked Amazon to replace and I couldn't get the second phone to read my sim at all. Yes, I considered the possibility that the problem was my sim card, but it worked in my old phone. So I ordered a Moto G4 play 16 GB for $99 instead. I couldn't be happier.

    "text": "I initially took advantage of the July 12th Prime Day through Amazon and pre-ordered this phone. I have only had one other smart phone. That phone is probably five years old. It is a Samsung Rugby Pro.  Since the sale was so good and I have been frustrated with my phone I decided for the price why not. We live in the Bermuda Triangle of cell phone service. Doesn't matter which provider. Everyone has to go outside to get reception. This is why we still have a land line.So far I am please with the phone. I do have a problem with it showing Emergency Calls Only and No cellular service. If I wait a few minutes it acquires service.  I have contacted AT&T; and they say it's the phone.  I was told to turn it off and reboot it back on. Sometimes that seems to work. Otherwise it will just pick up service again.When I had my stuff migrated over from the old phone to the new none of my apps followed. I now have to go back in and download them again.My husband liked the dual sim card feature because he has a work phone and his personal phone that he has to carry. For the price I went ahead and ordered him one also. We haven't got it set up yet. We will have to see how it works out.Since BLU is not a common phone in the American market there is a narrow field in which cases are available. I did find one style of case on Amazon. With the second phone I purchase a case for each phone. Two cases were a little over $13.00 and I am very please with them.I feel that I have received a good value for what it cost to purchase this phone.",

I wanted to add a data plan for one month with T mobile so I bought their one month plan while in the US just for the data portion as my AT&T; SIM card is a go phone plan we've had for a long time that is only for cell / voice. No data on this plan. But the phone soesnt work properly with both SIM cards - I only the att works and t mobile data won't work. If tried swapping the SIM cards to different slots, change the preferential settings for the data, voice, and it doesn't work properly. In some cases if u select preferences for data to work on T-Mobile and ATT for cell/ voice, the SIM card for att stops working.",

    "text": "Nice phone in many ways, but ... beware of WiFi connectivity issues for this Android phone which may interfere with some WiFi routers/settings,  and I still have not been able to connect & transfer files via USB with my Windows 10 desktop.We have had 4 days of Internet / LAN problems because it seems using wifi on this phone interferes with our primary (DLink) router & bring our LAN & Internet access (for 2 desktops, ROKU, Smarthub, Alexa, & more) completely down!  OUCH! Changing the router WiFi settings to eliminate higher speed 802.11n usage seems to resolve this problem ... but that is not very nice, and may not be acceptable to everyone.Perhaps the phone should come with a WARNING that it will interfere with high speed WiFi options on connected networks (802.11n)I have had this phone for only 1 week, so take this into account. If the above issues get fully resolved my rating for this phone will improve considerably:  I like most things about this new phone.UPDATES:  I have updated the firmware in my D-Link router, and can now run 802.11n on the WiFi network without my BLU R1 hosing the router :-) Note that other Android devices were NOT hosing the router on the previous firmware version ... o telling who was doing what to whom!  And after many hours of research & various attempts, I was able to install a Windows 10 MTP USB device driver that a) installs, and b) works with this phone:  this is a Windows problem.",

    "text": "My wife and I bought two of these phones, I bought this model; she bought the model with less memory.Our experience has been such that I recommend against purchase.1. Both phones gave poor voice service after a firmware update. After much calling, and emailing with BLU, they exchanged new phones for the old. Same problems. Neither BLU nor TING, my carrier was able to solve the issue. TING even contacted T-Mobile to have them check the towers in my area. Finally, through trial and error, I set the phones to operate at 3G, and they carried voice fine. These phones are supposed to be 4G LTE. Not ours!2. Neither phone would ever send or receive pictures via text. Both our old phones, which were BLU's also, texted pictures without any problem. We were planning on a trip in September, after we sent the original phones to the factory, so I went to WalMart and bought a $19.95 phone, and it texted pictures fine. All this was with the same carrier, TING. BTW, I recommend TING highly.I finally gave up and got another brand of phone which texts pictures without a problem. We are shopping for a replacement for the wife's phone. After this experience, we are avoiding BLU products altogether.I am glad that others have not had our experience. Ours was not the case. It is very exasperating to have a phone, which we have become very used to having, and not be able to depend on it.",

    "text": "Seriously, I can not tell you how surprised I am at this phone. I bought this phone because my Samsung Note 4 was putting out on me. I liked the Note and was pretty weary about buying this phone at such a cheap price, but after doing quite a bit of research on the specs and comparing them with bigger named brands, I realised that with bigger brands you are mostly buying the brand name. So, I decided to go for it. And, boy, am I happy with it! It's fast and efficient for what I use it for.I've had the phone for about a month now and I play games on it several times a day. I have yet to experience any significant lag or power issues. It's installed with the stock Android software, which it actually REALLY nice since you don't have to worry about stupid programs from Verizon, or sprint, or whoever. It does, however, come pre-installed with the Amazon apps. And that is actually great for me since I use those apps anyway! The only real downside I have seen is that there is no fast charge. It does take a good 2-3 hours or more to charge.Now, let's talk about the ads. Yes, you will see ads on your lock screen when you don't have any notification, but that's it... Literally. That's it! I am thoroughly impressed with how unintrusive the ads are. I honestly bearly even notice they are there.Needless to say, I will be coming back to all the Prime phones when this one goes out.",

    "text": "It's tough to review this phone. On the one hand, it is a (mostly) working phone for only $60, on the other hand, I hated every moment of using it.Speed: The processor in this thing is pretty rough, and it really showed. The phone is quite slow for even normal tasks. I got the 16GB version which has 2 GB RAM. Even with the extra gig I found myself often running low and having to clear out the memory. I would NOT recommend getting the 8GB version with only 1GB of RAM, you will run out quickly.Call Quality: Calls sound good on this phone and reception is generally the same as other phones I've used. No wi-fi calling though.Wi-Fi: Only 2.4GHz on this so it can be quite slow at times. Wi-Fi would cut out completely if I tried using a bluetooth speaker or other bluetooth devicesSpeaker: This thing is quite pitiful, very little sound comes out of it and it's on the back of the phone.Overall, while I did not like the phone, part of this is because I have a long commute on public transportation so I'm on my phone 2+ hours a day browsing the web, playing games, and listening to music. If you are looking for a simplistic smartphone that gets you by, this will work. If you want something that is enjoyable to use, look elsewhere and sadly, at more expensive phones. Also please note that I returned mine because of the issue with the bluetooth and because of my general unhappiness with the device.",

    "text": "This phone is an amazing value!  I bought this as a Prime member.  I decided that I wanted to try it out with FreedomPop, since they offer free mobile plans.  I got this for about $50 and the FreedomPop SIM card was only 99 CENTS.The phone arrived first and of course I had to connect it to our wifi and start playing.  I was immediately impressed.  It looks and feels like a high end phone.  Yes, there are ads but they are unobtrusive.  They are on the lock screen similar to the Kindle Fires.  There is also an Amazon widget with ads that you can not remove from the home screen - BUT - you CAN move it all the way to the last screen, if you would like.  Th at works for me.I got the FreedomPop SIM card the next day.  Let me just say that if you plan to use this with FreedomPop, it might be wise to WAIT until the SIM car arrives.  I couldn't the the FreedomPop Messaging app to download no matter what I tried, but it is required in order for the service to work.  I called their support (on hold for about an hour).  Finally, the solution was to do a factory reset on the phone.  And then it worked with absolutely no issue.  I am not sure why, but could have waited to play with it, if I would have known.Made the first phone call to my mom to test it out.  The sound was as good as any other cell phone I have used.  I am an Apple user all the way, but this phone did not disappoint me at all.  I got it as a first phone for my son to use, and didn't want to spend a ton.  This fit the bill.",

    "text": "Purchased two of these.  The screen on the first cracked for no apparent reason within the first 30 days and Amazon replaced it with a new one.  After that we ordered a second phone along with the Amazon case (SPARIN [2-PACK] BLU R1 HD Case, [Lightweight] [Anti Scratch] TPU Case for BLU R1 HD, Crystal Clear).  Our teenage daughter dropped the second phone, in its case, from 3 feet and the screen completely shattered.  Small pieces, shards of glass.  It was 10 days past the return date and Amazon is unable to help.  This phone is a good value at first glance, but I would not recommend it due to the fact that it is very fragile.

    "text": "The new Amazon Blu R1 HD may not be the fastest smartphone out there but it does give great bang for the buck. I ran Antutu benchmarking app on it and it scored a respectable 34,000. That is about the same as a flagship Moto X from 2013. This is, after all, an entry level phone but even though the benchmark numbers are middling, I have not experienced any performance issues using it for day to day smartphone things like email, web browsing, reading online news, and entering PDA like info into my Calendar, To Do List, etc. In fact, I use this pretty much as a PDA instead of picking up my tablet near my night stand. The phone is light and has a great HD screen. I have not tried any gaming on it so i can't report as to how it performs on games. I am assuming it would not be great at them given the middling performance numbers.Even though this is a new phone, there are accessories for it. I bought a case and a QI Wireless Charging Receiver Module Pad which I connected to the USB port and taped to the back of the phone under it's case so I have wireless QI charging for only a few extra dollars. Who would have ever thought one could have QI wireless charging in a phone that cost less than $100 new! I am very happy with the phone and would recommend to anyone maybe not as a daily driver but definitely as a backup phone or PDA device.",

If you have notifications, the ads are just tiny bubbles on the lockscreen. It's worth paying the bargain price.The phone responds very quickly. It comes loaded with all the Amazon features you could want, like access to the music and videos that Prime offers. The camera is pretty fantastic, as the shudder speed is lightening fast. No delay when you tap to take a picture! Just \"Click!\", picture taken.I have already loaded it with just about everything I could need and have not even begun to tap into the SD card, so that's a plus.My old phone bit the dust a few days ago and I decided to give this one a try based on the price until I could afford a \"good\" phone. This is it. I don't need another phone.UPDATE: 6 months later and I still love the phone. Unfortunately, today I dropped it, and the \"Gorilla Glass\" shattered into a million pieces and I discovered that there are no parts to repair it with, so that's the only down-side I can find with this phone. I will be buying another BLU R1 HD, and as my wife complains about her Samsung Galaxy, I'm trying to convince her to get one as well.",

I have had a Windows phone (HTC) and loved it, but support in the way of aps was just never there and quickly deteriorating.  I got a similar BLU phone for my teenage daughter a few years ago and she really liked it (although she was limited to data usage on wifi only).  I opted for this phone with the Prime Exclusive package (ads) because I spend a lot of time on Amazon anyway & other reviews led me to believe the ads were really unobtrusive.  I AM GLAD I DID.  I love this phone.  It is easy to set up, use, etc.  The ads show up on lockscreen and on the second homepage, but are really not a big deal & don't interfere with function at all.  There are lots of apps available and they are easy to install/uninstall.  So much functionality.  Also, the back snaps on & off easily so you can swap out SIM and data cards.  The only negative I have found is that YOU DEFINITELY NEED A CASE.  I got a case (which works great), but managed to drop the phone on my hardwood floor before I got the case on.  As a result I got a little bend in the edge of the case & now the back has a little gap that I cannot get to close all the way (maybe a 1mm opening).  It didn't affect function at all & is now covered up with a sturdy case.",

I went with the 16GB model for the 2GB of RAM, because you can never go wrong with more RAM.Setup was a breeze, and everything is running smoothly. As others have said, the camera is \"OK\" \u2013 which is fine by me, as I don't take a lot of photos and the ones that I take are mostly to say, \"Hey! Look what I just saw!\" or along those lines.Taking the back off to insert the SIM card was a little unnerving at first. I was afraid to break a plastic connector. Once it came off though I noticed that they were like small teeth that wouldn't break off as easily as some of the clips on other phones. Usually those types have far fewer clips, thus the larger size, which lends more easily to snapping.The advertisements are unobtrusive and, in my opinion, well worth it for the deep discount on the already discounted device.",

    "text": "Like many here upon receipt I loved this phone and was very impressed.  Yes, it is a budget phone but it was also my first cell phone and thanks to Amazon the price was amazing.  And for a budget phone it was really nice.  I found clarity on calls just fine, music played great and the speed of the interface was impressive.  The only thing was for some reason BING which I had installed lagged when loading.  I even was fine with the camera.  A happy person I was - until 5 months.  It started with a call I placed and it showed as dialing but there was no ringing and no connection being made.  I was at home so tested it to ring my home phone.  Same thing and no ring.  A fluke I hoped.  But then it happened over and over.  Then often when I would receive an incoming call and go to accept it the screen would go black.  I would try to move the screen and then it would flicker over many pages.  Calls were either lost or went to voicemail before I could answer it.  And this was the phone, not the reception where I was. Then I would be on a call, end it and the phone would show I was still on a call with that person.  Many people would text me \"Did you butt dial me??\"  Then when a call would come in, every time I tried to hit accept, no matter how hard I pressed or slid across it, it usually would not answer it and then it started ending calls on its own.  So right there is enough.  If a cell phone cannot be used reliably for calls it is deemed worthless.But that is not all.  I had started using wireless headphones and the music would skip as I listened to it.  I just assumed it was the reliability of the headphones.  But then I bought some bluetooth speakers and they did the same thing.  So I watched the phone play the music as it happened and it was the phone starting and stopping the music and skipping tracks and not the bluetooth connection.  Then the Ask Google stopped playing what I asked it to.  I even called Google Music and they were immensely helpful and definite conclusion was it was the phone for the music played fine on my desktop computer.  So music - worthless.Lastly and very important I had installed a 64 gb microSD card and installed it as Internal Storage.  It worked fine and luckily only had apps not used very often on it plus music and photos for after the 5 months the phone started deleting the card, switching the phone from one type of storage to another and all my stuff eventually disappeared.  All I am saying is BEWARE .  I took very good care of this phone.  It never got wet, was never dropped and I had an app to make sure it did not overheat.  I treated it like a baby and the phone literally died.  I hope it was a fluke for me and most of you don't experience this but please be watchful.  These were not minor issues but things that deemed the phone unusable.  I am upgrading now to the Moto G 4th Gen still with the Amazon Prime deal and hope things will be better.",

    "text": "Waaaaay back when Android phones first came out, my wife had several and they were all hunks of junk. I eventually ended up switching from Blackberry to iPhone and vowed to never, ever go the Android route. Fast forward about six years later and I've found that I've fallen in love with Android by accident.In an effort to save money, my wife and I decided to ditch AT&T;, downgrade from the iPhone 6, and take a chance on metroPCS. We initially decided to go with one of their free options at the time, the LG K7, with plans to upgrade to new iPhones later. I ended up very surprised. It honestly wasn't a terrible phone for the three months I used it. The phone was much better than previous Androids my wife had, even though what she had was supposed to be the best on the market at the time. The economic Android has turned me away from the iPhone, at least until Apple decides to let their users have a bit more control.Of course, this left me wanting to explore a better Android option, which led me to the BLU R1 HD. From reddit, to YouTube, to techie websites; all of the information I found about this phone was positive with very few cons. After a month or so of research, I finally decided to make the purchase.We've only had the phones for less than a week and I couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase. The ease of use is amazing. The phone is quick to respond and the pictures are comparable to that of the iPhone 6 (except for low light settings). There's nothing cheap looking about the phone at all. It feels good in your hand and doesn't feel like a cheap piece of plastic like other econ Androids.Right out of the box, the battery life is better than any other iPhone I've ever owned. On a typical day with my last iPhone I would be at 20% or lower by midday. I'm currently nearly finished with my workday and am currently at 43% with the BLU R1 HD with normal daily usage.I'd also like to mention it works perfectly on metroPCS (metro PCS). In fact, their service works much better on the BLU R1 HD. Phone calls are much more clear and aren't dropped like they were on the LG K7. However, I was unable to activate the phone online or by phone. I had to go into the store. Take your sim card with you. Since they use micro-sim cards, you'll need a nano adapter if you want to use your current sim. They may have an adapter that they'll give you for free. They were all out while I was there. If they don't have one available, you'll be charged $10 for a new sim.Also, if you're worried about the ads, they're hardly noticeable. I only get full-page ads once every couple of days or when I reboot the phone.If you've been reading about this phone and have been thinking of getting one, believe the hype. I really can't believe the 16GB with ads was only $59.99. I cannot say enough good about this phone. If and when it starts to crap out, I'll be sure to update this review with my issues.One more thing, I would recommend getting\u00a0BLU R1 HD Case,[3 Pack] ATLY(TM) [Black][Clear][Purple] Soft TPU case From BLU R1 HD\u00a0instead of the case BLU makes for this phone. I ordered both and the brand case did actually feel cheap and pocket lint stuck to it badly due to the type of rubber it was made of. The ALTY cases are sleek.",

While the camera is not as advanced as my Samsung, it really is not a big issue. The phone has a nice feel to it. It is extremely lightweight and the back cover feels a little flimsy but I purchased a case for about $9 that took care of that issue. I have been able to text and make calls with zero issues on this phone. I even downloaded a couple of games to test the speed and honestly I cannot tell the difference between this phone and my main cellphone. I feel like this phone should cost a lot more than what Amazon is charging and that is why it feels like such a great deal.

    "text": "10/19/16 - Just wanted to add that this is a dual sim and the front camera has a flash too. Front Camera Flash is something that not even top notch expensive phones have introduced yet. This is a feature that is not well advertised by BLU. If they do, it will be a good selling point.The phone was dropped once on the hardwood floor and has scratches and very small dent on the corners on the bezel. I thought it was metal but was not. Still a great phone.--------------I ordered this as a secondary phone and it works great so far. For $60 with ads on the lockscreen is not bad at all. The ads are a little annoying but I can cope with that because of the price. In the box comes the charger only. I was expecting a headset and a TPU cover like you get in other BLU phones. I guess its because of the price they cut corners. The phone itself is nice. It looks good and not cheap as long as you do not read its BLU. The box says its curved screen but its a gimmick. The phone is fast (so far), not laggy (so far), brightness is good. The back cover is rubberish and thus do not slip. It makes the feel of soft grip even when your hands are sweaty or wet. The sides are nice and look good. One odd thing is that the power charger goes in upside down as opposed to other phones.The operating system is good. It feels stock operating system without a lot of junk, expect Amazon's. One thing you can do is that when you first turn on the phone and go through the setup process, do not sign in to your Amazon account. Skip it. Then when the whole process is done. Go to Settings>Apps and then select all the apps you do not want and \"Disable\" them. This is what I do on every android phone I get. This way you will not see unwanted apps. I was thinking of rooting but then its too much work and not worth it especially when you can disable pretty much every app you want.The best feature is that its DUAL SIM and its LTE. It works well on TMobile LTE and the LTE coverage it not spotty either. The speed is good. The Visual Voicemail works by itself on this phone. There was not need to load an app.Since the phone is subsidized for lock screen ads, I must say that its still worth it. Just pretend that the ad on the lockscreen is your wallpaper and just scroll up on the screen and the phone unlocks.",

Hence, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered a $60 phone (prime member) that was 1/12 of the price of my main.  This phone certainly opened my eyes on how much of the sticker price is the actual brand.PROs:- pretty fast for all intents and purposes, most apps open just as fast as on my iPhone 7, videos play instantly, just like my main phone, download speeds are just as fast as the iPhone 7 do on a 2.4 GHz network (i.e. maxes out at 54 Mbps).- The screen is beautiful, hardly can tell a difference to the iPhone in terms of resolution- pretty fast for all intents and purposes (can play games)- super lightweight- very good battery life, better than iPhone 7 plus- runs Android marshmallow- doesn't feel all too cheap, I mean sure it is not an iPhone, but it's not that much worse- dual SIM, good for travelCons:- The speaker is not very good, way too quiet!- The camera is really subpar, possibly a dealbreaker for anyone who seriously is considering using a phone as a camera for vacation- no 5 GHz WiFi support, so no 300 Mbps download. You're stuck at 54 Mbps!- missing LTE bands (such as 3 or 21 which are the only ones available in some smaller European countries)- DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON OR SPRINT IN THE USA, WORKS WITH VERIZON SIM CARDS IN EUROPE (ROAMING)- Second dual SIM slot won't work for AT&T; (2G only)- no NFC payment, no fingerprint scanner (its just $60!)Summary:Good as primary phone for anyone who doesn't care about the fastest and best phone out there or even for children.

The phone itself is amazing, but the company, BLU, has not released Linux kernel source for the phone and violated the GPL. The GPL requires that kernel source is available to any potential customer from day 1, but BLU didn't release it then. A group of developers and myself from XDA have been requesting kernel source for the last month, but to no avail. We have given the company a whole month beyond the due date for this release, and it still hasn't been released. Failure to fully comply with the GPL makes this phone's use of the Linux kernel an instance of software piracy, which is illegal, and we are currently arranging to take legal action against BLU. All you have to do is release the kernel source, and all this goes away. Seriously.",

    "text": "My previous two phones were an iPhone 4 and Nexus 5X and I love this phone.  After breaking the screen on my previous $450 and $350 phones, I decided to get something cheaper because (a) I don't play any games so I don't need fancy hardware and (b) I'll probably break this one too.This phone surprised me.  It doesn't feel cheap; it actually feels great in my hand and works well.  All my go-to apps work fine, which for me are maps, Audible, Yelp, and assorted other low-power apps.  I can't say how performant it would be for games.  The camera seems decent enough as well.I doesn't have a fingerprint reader, so you'll unlock it with a swipe pattern or passcode, unless you have an Android watch.  It paired with my Motorola watch without issue and a newly released feature allows you to keep the phone unlocked while in proximity to the watch, so I don't miss the sensor at all.I opted for the version with ads and they don't bother me.  There's a panel on the notification page as well as a widget you can put on your last page of apps with your infrequently used stuff.  It's really unobtrusive.  I generally dislike ads but since I felt I was taking a chance on an unknown brand phone, I decided to go real cheap in case it was a dud.  To the contrary, it's a gem -- a good phone for a rock-bottom price.  I'm amazed.The best part is the microSDX slot, so you can expand the storage.  My previous phones didn't have that capability.  Indeed, it was that feature that encouraged me to take a chance on this phone.  Now I have plenty of room for all my apps, a dozen audiobooks, and can take photos and videos with impunity on my vacation without worrying about uploading to the cloud to make room.If you're just looking for a decent functional phone, this is a great choice.  I'll never buy an overpriced phone again.",

    "text": "I bought this phone because I was aware that with release 7.4.2 of their version of Android 6.0 [BLU_R0010UU_V7.4.2...], they supported T-Mobile's band 12.I received this phone on Saturday 3-Jun-2017.  It is shipped with [BLU_R0010UU_V6.6...], thus no band 12.  Further investigation on my part I found this was the same release of the OS that was found to have a major security flaw back in November of 2016.  I tried emailing the BLU three times with no answer.  I called and I got someone who wasn't even familiar with the security flaw.  I had to tell her the web address on THEIR site.After an hour with this person, she assured me that I had no worries as the issue had been fixed.  I said, \"Yes, I can agree with that, but what you are not understanding is that my phone will not update!\"  So still security flawed and no Band 12.  All she can do is say wait 24-48 hours.  It's been over 120 hours and no update.I called back and then I was told to e-mail them screen shots.Four phone calls, several emails and nothing from BLU.Thursday, 15th of June, I went to Amazon and requested a new phone.  I received it Saturday 17th June and as soon as I started it up and logged in, the phone went through an update.  It's now on their 8.4 release of Android 6.  Funny how I didn't have to wait 24-48 hours for the update on the new phone...Hypothesis, the Wireless Updater on the old phone was release 5.1 which was part of the security flaw.  I would wager they blocked upgrades for that release since it would have to update through the Chinese company that introduced the \"back door\" security flaw.  First level support at BLU should have been able to answer this.Old phone was manufactured in December 2016 and the new phone in February 2017, further supporting the hypothesis.However, with all that said.  For a $60 phone, it's is OK.  Lightweight, decent pictures, great battery.  It's cool to see Gorilla glass on a budget phone.I just hope you don't have to deal with BLU's horrible customer support.",

When I opened my door, it fell 1 foot and cracked from the bottom left to the middle of the screen (with a case). I had it for about 12 hours. I'm not sure if it was my phone or if it was a fluke but I'd suggest not wasting money on this phone if you're prone to dropping your phone because it seems to break very easily. The phone itself is good but I am very disappointed as to how easily the screen shatters despite the claim that it has gorilla glass and will not shatter. I'd expect a lot better.EDIT: Blu customer service was no help. Would be $50 for a new screen, when obviously I could buy a new phone for that price. It would be great if another company could make a repair kit like there is for other models. My Nokia windows phone and [previous Samsung could withstand much more wear and tear.",

    "text": "I wanted to live with this phone for two months before writing a review and it is now 2 months since I bought this awesome and and all I can saw is, it is awesome!  I bought this $59 phone for my wife, she upgraded from the Blu Studio 5.0 to this R1 HD and she can't stop talking about how great this phone is.  We are a family of four and three of us have Blu phones, my oldest son is the lone holdout, he has to have the latest and greatest Galaxy phone!  This Blu phone, with Amazon Offers, is one of the best phones you can buy for the price!  We have the 16db storage with the 2gb ram.  for the extra $10 it is so worth it!  This phone is fast and you hardly notice the offers on the lock screen!  The screen is beautiful and the camera takes fine pictures.  Everyone seems to kill the camera in previous reviews however for the pictures my wife takes, it is fine!  She loves the Android 6.0.  I have the VIVO 5 and I would love to have 6.0 on my phone!  The Amazon apps, which are pre-loaded, are fine!  She shops on Amazon so she is used to having the apps on her phone. The phone didn't come with the case or screen protector, like our previous Blu phones did, however for for a very small price, you can pick them up when you buy the phone.  The phone has most of the 4G LTE bands you will need for T-Mobile.  Her internet is very fast on the 4G LTE.  Overall I am very happy I bought the phone for my wife and I am very happy to continue to buy Blu phones.",

    "text": "I was very hesitant to buy this phone at first for my wife. We have always had phones from well known brands like samsung, motorola, sony, or apple. I looked around at some other reviews of BLU phones and decided it would be safe to try this one. I must say I was extremely surprised. For the price this is an excellent phone. It has a very sleek look, good feel in the hand. The screen is nice and clear, speaker is good enough, and the speed is actually quite impressive. It might not be as fast with gaming apps or other RAM intensive apps but in terms of normal browsing it keeps up very well.Camera: We got this phone not expecting an amazing camera. And while it isn't amazing, it works really well. It's an 8MP so you can't have too high expectations, and for the price they have to cut back somewhere. Compared to other budget phones though, I think this camera exceeds most of those.The amazon ads: We weren't sure what to expect with the amazon prime ads on the lock screen, we didn't anticipate being bothered by it too much and that's pretty much how it is. Sometimes they actually look pretty cool and almost look like a neat wallpaper. They easily dismiss though as you go to unlock your screen. A very small inconvenience for the discount it gets you.All other functions of this phone work as expected. No glitches, no issues, no dislikes so far and my wife has been using it a couple months now. I am almost even tempted to get another one just to have a spare phone lying around. You really can't beat this price for this quality of phone. Screen size is just large enough too.If you're looking to replace your phone, or just get something new without breaking the bank, this is it. So far very reliable, runs the latest android, and can handle most of what daily phone users throw at it. It really makes it hard to look at other phones costing $200-$400 for the same thing. Until we run into issues, this phone will have 5/5 stars from me.",

I had been doing hands on research and looking at purchasing a Samsung s6, but was not happy at the price for the phone. Then I came across the Blu r1 HD. I took a chance and bought it (16 MB) without the ads for $109.00. I don't have Amazon prime and it never really use it enough to justify getting the phone with ads.I've had the phone for 4 months now and I can honestly say it has met and even exceeded my expectations. Everything I wanted in an s6 (I really don't need all the bells and whistles) I got with the r1 HD and then some I . Battery life is great - I can get 1 to 2 days use on a single charge and I use my phone a lot. Also it has a quick charge time which helps when I'm in a hurry. It runs Android 6 with no problems at all. I currently have close to 200 apps on the phone and it handles them all without any problems. I have it connected to my smartwatch and it runs flawlessly. I have never had a dropped call in these past 4 months and the sound quality is great (better than my s3 for sure!).  It does all that I was expecting an s6 to do at a fraction of the cost.So I would encourage you to save the money by not buying the latest and the greatest (at least for this month) and invest it in a phone that does what a phone should do.I have not received any compensation for this review from Blu; it's just the truth!",

    "text": "8/31/16 Update: After using the phone now for about a week I have to downgrade my review because it does not seem to handle weak tower signals well as a phone! I chose AT&T; because my wife uses an inexpensive Straight Talk LG phone which is on the AT&T; network and it works well from home where signal is less than optimum. But this phone, showing the same signal level breaks up terribly, making it unusable as a phone. Data rates are great. All wifi and app performance is impressive. But as a phone it is essentially unusable! I have worked around it somewhat using Google Voice and Hangout Dialer but if this is reality, I'll have to abandon it.I've now had this phone for two full days. I have used Straight Talk for several years and switched from a Galaxy SIII, which I had for a couple years and liked other than it was stuck on Android 4.2 and was only 3g. I was worried the Blu phone would be \"too good to be true\" after reading an online review by some techi person. But at $59 for the 16g phone what did I have to lose. Switching from the Galaxy to the Blu went very smoothly. Did it all online with a Bring Your Own Phone kit from Walmart.It was live in about half hour or less. I had previously gotten it set up with wifi and my google account so nearly everything was automatically downloaded onto the phone and reinstalled. I have been surprised how many things I did NOT have to do to get it set up pretty close to the way my Galaxy SIII was. It doesn't seem to come with an email client other than the GMAIL one so I installed Microsoft Outlook on it and without too much fussing have all but one of my email accounts working on it. The final one is through the TDS phone service and requires lots of advanced settings. I'll get it eventually.The phone is faster than the SIII, the screen resolution and brightness is very good, It feels solid and all the buttons feel like quality. I like Android 6 much better than 4.2, particularly the fact that a fast SD card can be configured as \"main memory\" so it appears that it essentially more or less gives you 16g plus your card as a single \"hard drive\".Oh yes, I got the \"Prime\" one which has adds but they aren't bothersome at all.So far I'm very happy with it.",

There was a phone, charger, and a tiny 3 page user manual that explained how to charge the phone and turn it on/off. Nothing else. That was a red flag. I ignored it and plugged my new phone in and charged it. Turned it on - wow, nice crisp colors and graphics. It was nicer and faster than my old phone, so I was happy. Until today. My phone died while I was out of town on a business trip. I got home, plugged it in, and tried to turn it on. It started up ok, but the screen went black after I entered my phone PIN. It cycled thru startup screen, screen saver, PIN, then blackness numerous times. It continued to do this even after it reached 100% charge. I was annoyed af. Turned the phone over, thinking I could take the battery out and put it back in. No such luck. Warranty is void if you remove the battery, which is built in. I discovered this how? After I pried the battery out, then read the fine print on the back of it after I realized that I had screwed up. Long story short, I was pissed enough by then to grab my 3 yr old Straight Talk phone which is slow af but at least reliable, which is apparently something the folks at Blu don't factor in when providing people with mf-ing phones... and write my first ever Amazon product review.This phone is not for the tech savvy or for those who enjoy the luxury of having a phone that DOESN'T 100% DIE AT ANY GIVEN SECOND WITH NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.And just fyi, I googled \"BLU phones suck\" and came across a Reddit user's comment that BLU phones are apparently just refurbished Chinese phones.There is also a Facebook page called, \"Blu phones suck\", which I liked and followed immediately.Shame on you, Amazon, for selling this garbage.

    "text": "If you are not a power user or a gamer, then this phone might be perfect for you. Many use their phones not as phones any more, but portable entertainment device + communication device. But for some, they primarily want simple communication device that can also occasionally entertain them (web surfing, YouTube, etc). If you are looking for something cheap but does the job efficiently, then you want to seriously consider BLU R1 HD (2GB RAM + 16GB storage). For my needs (I am not a gamer or take a lot of pictures, I just need email, text, call, social media, web surfing, and YouTube, etc), and I was looking for something between $100.00 - $150.00. My choices were: Moto G4 Play (either with Amazon Ad or without), Moto G4 (with Amazon Ad), BLU Life One X2 (2GB + 16GB variant), then I saw Amazon selling BLU R1 HD for $59.99 (with Amazon Ad), I jumped on it. After reading about the product and its spec, $60 was a bargain. Amazon Ad on the lock screen does not bother me one bit. There are many reviews already (both good and bad - you can judge them for yourself), and I just want to add few more info and tips that might help you.UPDATE (12/21): If you wait a little, BLU will come out with R1 Plus (a slightly upgraded version of R1 HD). The rumor is, this item will be also available for Amazon Prime variant. You can google BLU R1 Plus for more info on the item.PROS (considering the price):1. BUILD. The phone is nicely built. No loose parts, feels solid all around. I was a bit surprised by this. Certainly not premium build (like Zenfone 3 Deluxe that costs $499.00), but certainly better than expected. Aluminum frame with curved Gorilla glass 3 is a nice touch - feels good to hold in hand. Polycarbonate removable back cover is also solid to touch.2. POWERFUL. The spec is not high end, but for the price, the spec is better than expected. Media Tek 6735 chip performs better than Snap Dragon 410 (Moto G4 Play - which costs more). Some say it is with par with SD 410, but it is not. It is snappier and handles the RAM better. With 2GB RAM, I had 15 apps (no games) opened, and it still had 500 MB RAM left. Almost everything was done under 1.5 GB RAM. This was really surprising, multitasking between several apps was great experience. But occasionally my sports app (CBS Sports) would crash, but interestingly ESPN app did not. I tested with another smartphone that was equipped with Snap Dragon 652 with 3GB RAM and R1 HD opens the app .5 second later than mid-range smartphone. That's just incredible. For a budget phone, the performance was very good.3. SCREEN SIZE. 5\" screen is perfect for me. I have 5.5\" screen, it is a tad big for my small hand, but 5\" screen is comfortable to hold and able to maneuver better with one hand. Of course, this is subjective to each user, but for those who have small hands this is a welcome form factor.4. DISPLAY. Wow, this thing is bright. Even though it has 294 ppi (just like Moto G4 Play), because of its 420 nit (nit refers to unit of brightness. Certainly much brighter than Moto G4 Play) you can easily see the screen outside. Even inside, i am using screen brightness to almost 15%.CONS (considering the price):1. SPEAKER. It is located on the back instead of the bottom of the phone. While it is livable, the sound is weak and low, but not distorted. If you want to watch a YouTube clip and want to hear it, you need to raise the volume almost to the max.2. NO ACCESSORIES. BLU usually ships their phones with: ear buds, screen protector and slim TPU case. But R1 HD only comes with a charger. So you need to get your own case and screen protector. There are decent cases and screen protectors in Amazon, so you can browse them for your need. For decent protection: i got a case that has four bumpers on the corners to protect further from the drop. Also for screen protection, I got QIBOX\u00a0QIBOX BLU-01 HD Screen Protector Anti-shock (Fits better and More Durable than Tempered Glass) Nanoshield HD Clear Shatterproof Protector for HD Phone Anti-bubble3. NO MARSHMALLOW 6.0.1. This comes with 6.0 and not 6.0.1. The BLU does not guarantee it will update it to 6.0.1. Still it is better than many other Android phones that come with Lollipop.TIPS (for maximizing phone performance):1. BE PATIENT and UPDATE Everything. When everything (system) is updated, the build version will be V.7.4.2 (check setting -> About Device -> custom build version). Security patch level (October 5, 2016). it may take 2 days to get the all the update. So be patient.2. UPDATE all the apps. I love the fact that R1 HD is almost stock Android with Amazon apps (that can be removed, but cannot be uninstalled). When all the apps are updated, you will see its performance as it was expected.3. If you need more storage, please get Class 10 micro SD, anything slower than that will slow down your apps. Consider Samsung Evo Micro SD\u00a0Samsung 16GB EVO MicroSDXC Memory Card with Adapter MB-MP16DA/AM. Anything less than Class 10, you will see lag and stuttering in your apps.4. If your battery drains real fast after overnight recharging (this is a software issue FYI), you can power it OFF (not reboot) and turn it ON again, then the battery will normally discharge. Apparently for some, this issue exists not just for this phone but many other Android phones.5. If you cannot access your phone from Windows 10 PC, then you must enable USB MTP mode.  To enable: Go to \"device manager\" -> Select Exclamation marked device -> \"Update Driver Software\" -> \"Browse from My Computer\" -> \"Let Me Pick From a List of Devices\" -> then select \"Show me All devices\"  -> Select \"MTP device (USB) -> It should work after that.All in all, this is a quality budget phone or a backup phone. But for many, who do not play games and take picture often, this will be more than enough. I really love this phone even with the ad. Highly, highly recommended!",

    "text": "The phone itself is nice looking at the display is of a high quality. My carrier is MetroPCS, after calling them to activate this phone on the network I can receive calls, send sms and mms, and use cellular data but I do not receive any incoming sms and mms. Metro tells me that the  everything on their side and in my phone is set up correctly, so it seems that I will not be able to use the built in messenger app to send and receive messages. This could be different with a different carrier, but I feel very misled by the answers in the q&a; about this product and metropcs.The ring volume and alarm volume are very low even when at max. I use my phone as my main alarm clock so this is a big deal to me. The good thing about this phone is that it was priced low so I will just use it for a few months and then replace it. This is frustrating to me though, I generally use my electronics until they wear out and I don't think I can do that with this item. I need messaging without using data, and I need it to function as an alarm clock.",

But the biggest flaw is in the operating system.  This is the first android phone I've ever owned that isn't able to transfer media to and from a computer via usb cord.  It can transfer photos but no other media.  I am unclear whether this is by design or if it is a software glitch but I find this extremely frustrating and I would not buy this phone again because of this.",

The phone lags a bit, but it usually goes away. And if you use Metro PCS, you have to call Customer Service and give them the IMEI number located on the side of the box the phone comes in. If you don't, your phone won't have service. Overall, this is a great phone for a great price. I highly recommend it.",

If you are buying this for ST, please note that this is a GSM Unlocked phone (which you will need to tell them otherwise you will be in customer service hell) and a new sim card will be needed (cannot use existing one from old phone).

    "text": "I still can't believe how awesome this phone is, especially for the price as a Prime member.There is 16GB of internal storage, and a slot to expand storage with an SD card. All the other phones I've owned in the last couple years have come with so much uninstallable bloatware that the storage is almost full before you even receive the phone. I got so tired of constantly having to delete things and force stop unnecessary apps! On this phone I have a few movies downloaded, a ton of apps, not to mention hundreds of photos and videos I've taken with my phone, and I just can't seem to run out of storage. As a Prime member, all my photos and videos automatically get uploaded to my Prime cloud storage (no limit!), So I could clean out my gallery and delete things worry free if I needed to, but so far that hasn't been necessary.Some reviewers dinged this phone for the photo quality, but while it's far from iPhone quality, I haven't had a problem. Most of my pictures come out clear, and the ones that don't are either due to my user error, or my toddler just moving too fast. I have stopped carrying around my HD digital camera because my phone works well enough and is much more convenient.The phone is fast, at any given time I have multiple apps and websites running, and have yet to experience any lag.The reason I dinged it a star is because the touch response is sometimes lacking. But if it's due to the gorilla Glass screen, I'm ok with it, seeing as how often I drop my phone (which is how I cracked the screen on my last phone), and how often my toddler throws it. I have not put on a screen protector, and after months of abuse this is still holding up without a scratch or a crack.The ads that pop up while the screen is locked are unobtrusive, and easy to dismiss. I actually like them because every once in a while the targeted ads display something I want to buy.All in all, you cannot beat the quality of this phone for the price. I would definitely buy another Blu if this phone needed replacing. It's a high quality product made in the USA. As a prepaid phone user who doesn't get phone insurance or discounts from my carrier, I couldn't dream of finding a better option.Oh, and by the way this was really easy to connect to my At&t; prepaid service.I've attached a photo that I took with this phone so you can judge the camera quality for yourself.",

    "text": "TLDR: This was a really good buy,I've had the phone (16 gig version without ads) for 8 months and it has held up fairly well. Out of the box it felt really nice, and was a major upgrade from a previous off-brand phone. I'm using the phone with tracfone services and it was a fairly easy and painless process. The reason I am only giving this phone 3 stars is for a few issues I had with it which were mostly my own fault.Within the first week of owning it, I dropped it and completely shattered the curved glass screen due to the phone being so slippery and the position of the lock button. This was a real bummer because this isn't a common brand of phone, and getting the screen fixed was as expensive as the phone itself. I would have just ordered another, but the phone was on international back order during this time. BUY A CASE and save yourself some hassle.Over the next few months my list of complaints was pretty low. Biggest issues was that the speaker is super quite. This was fixed by downloading an app and changing the speaker settings. It is much louder now without issue on calls. Smaller issues is that the front facing camera is a little lacking, in comparison to the rear camera which always took very nice photos.About 2 months ago, I accidentally went swimming with the phone and was able to save it with some rice. However, this didn't totally save it. The flash/ flashlight no longer work, nor does the proximity sensor or the volume down button. The screen shuts off automatically when I make or receive calls with no setting to change this because of the proximity sensor which is meh. Lastly I am getting ghost input on the screen which is highly annoying but I attribute this to the swimming and breaking the screen. It is still hanging in there after all I've done to it, and I just recently opted upgrade to the next price range to see what else is out there. Honestly nothing in this price category is going to beat this phone.Other things: The battery life is fairly average usually lasting me a full day with medium usage and brightness off most of the time. I heard something about BLU and amazon putting spyware in the phone so I would recommend looking more into that. Overall a good buy and I would recommend it, but dealing with my own mistakes made this phone not ideal for me.",

    "text": "Most likely you're getting this phone because you fall in 2 buckets: 1) it's a good temporary phone, or 2) it does everything you want it to do on a smartphone with good speed, storage and screen resolution (and you don't care about camera quality THAT much)I got this phone as a temp phone when I lost my Samsung S5, but since I found my S5 I honestly have been sticking to this phone as my main device. To be honest, the R1 can reasonably be compared to an S5 (launched in April, 2014) - if you don't mind a phone that's comparable to 3-year old flagship phone. For $60, this is amazing. You're saving yourself hundreds of dollars (S5 launched at $650)! Of course, it's not a fair comparison, but it's close.1) First off, you are getting 16 GB of storage. This is the minimum you should get these days, as OS and default app updates eat up 5 to 6 GB on initial setup. This gives you wiggle room for dozens of apps (and I use a lot for personal and work) and a fairly large cache so your phone can run smooth and boot up apps/web pages fast.2) You get 2 GB RAM - pretty good honestly with everything else at this price, comparable to S5 and iPhone 7. No need to remind yourself to close apps often (although you should) or worry about restarting your phone often to kill off hidden background tasks.3) Close to stock android. Unlike Samsung, you don't have terrible TouchWiz UI, tons of apps preinstalled on the phone, and extraneous default animation and settings that give subtle performance hiccups over time.4) Android 6.0 out of the box. Nougat may be out, and O might be coming soon, but 6.0 is still fairly great. UI is fluid, battery optimizations are many folds ahead of 5.x, and you can save apps directly to external SD cards5) Dual SIM card slots. I haven't personally used the second, but it's definitely a nice addition for those who need it.6) HD Screen. Might not be Full HD or AMOLED, but 720p is still really good. As long as you don't see pixelated icons and fuzzy text, we're all satisfied right?7) Gorilla Corning Glass 3, like S5. No need to worry about scratches from everyday items.8) Expandable memory to 64 GB. It's there if you need it.These are basically the highlight features for me, and the most critical for what I \"truly need\" in a smartphone. Now if you're wondering about the camera, don't wonder. You're not buying this for the camera - it's just not good. Front-camera is decent compared to others, back is just a different story, almost the same as the front quality despite what specs say. But it will do - it will take early 2010s quality photos. Like I said, you're buying this phone either for temporary reasons or for a good budget smart \"phone\".And of course, you don't have nice-to-haves like water/dust resistance or a fingerprint sensor.But again, for $60 this is a steal. Sure, there's ads (that you can't turn off as of latest updates) but live with the ads and you have a slightly old flagship phone that's zippy and - based on my tests - lasts me the whole day until bedtime in normal use (something my S5 barely did when I first got it).",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this phone. For the price (currently $60 with Amazon Prime Ads), it's very snappy, functional, and has some unique features like dual SIMs and a microSD card slot.  I purchased this for use as a home mini-tablet/Google Cast head/back up phone for T-Mobile. Performance was outstanding. Even while downloading and installing apps, the menus never slowed down. I was amazed. It never seemed to stutter either.But, there are some flaws, the last one was the one that forced me to exchange this for a Moto G4 Play (at almost twice the price):- The WiFi is 2.4GHz only. This is problematic in an apartment building where the three 2.4GHz bands are flooded. I didn't see any performance problems, right away, but it's something to be aware of.- The speakerphone is on the back. This can cause it to be easily muffled if you place it down on a table/sofa, etc.- **** The phone DOES NOT support Band 12, nor VoLTE for T-Mobile ****.What this last point means: If you live in a Band 12 (Extended LTE coverage area), you will not be able to use it. It'll be the same old \"kinda crappy\" coverage TMobile is known for. Additionally, while you can force enable it through some unauthorized software, it will only support data, not voice. This is the VoLTE (Voice over LTE) feature.  The major sticking point is that promotional material from BLU's website, press releases, and at one time Amazon stated that these features would be added shortly after release as an OTA update. It's been 4 months and the current response from BLU customer support is that the phone does not currently support these features, nor are there plans to patch them in.The phone was ultimately exchanged for a Moto G4 Play with Amazon Prime ads (currently $99).",

    "text": "There's no way you'll find a better phone, at this (with Amazon Offers) price. I'm not going to compare it to a current model flagship device from the \"big boys\", but I will compare it to my iPhone 5s. Keep in mind that this is a totally subjective comparison - no measurements, just real world experience.Because this runs Android 6.0, extra memory added via a microSD card can be configured as adoptable/internal storage. I did so with a 64GB Samsung UHS-1 card, for about $20. So, the total investment here is about $80 for what is essentially a phone with about 80GB of storage. Oh,, and yes, I bought the 2GB RAM/16GB storage variant of the phone.First, as for lock screen ads: it's a total non-issue. Yes, you'll see full screen ads if you have no other notifications, but I always have a weather app configured with a persistent forecast notification. So, the only ad I ever see is a small swipe away ad. I don't even bother swiping them away. What's the point? For a $50 savings on the phone, this is a more than fair trade-off.Performance wise, it feels just as snappy as my 5s, though of course, there's a learning curve if you're not already familiar with Android. I'm running the Nova Launcher (as I do on all Android devices), and it runs perfectly.Being an LCD (not AMOLED) display, the colors are not quite as vibrant as on my BLU Vivo XL, but you can tweak the Miravision display options for a great looking experience. Definitely right up there with my 5s. Perhaps better.Resolution, schmezolution - this display is crystal clear if you're not looking it with a microscope (I'm not).I picked this up to see what $59.99 will get you, and not only am I blown away, I'm a bit more annoyed with the flagship phone makers, who (IMO) certainly aren't delivering 10-15 times the phone, at their obscene prices.The audio is acceptable, not stellar, but it's fine (especially with earbuds). The camera may be it's weakest feature, but I'm not a press photographer or movie maker. I just need a decent photo now and then, and this takes them. It's a joy to use, and feels great in the hand (with no case). I figured spending 20% of the phone's cost on a case was just plain silly. If it drops and becomes unusable, just buy another. Overall, if you want a nice capable phone that will handle most anything but really demanding gaming, I think you'll be happy with the R1 HD.

    "text": "As a quick summary\u2026 GET THIS PHONE! You get 90% of the bells and whistles of a premium \u201cflagship\u201d for a fraction of the price. For $60 you simply cannot go wrong. Phone works perfectly and does everything I need it to do.In depth: I purchased this phone as a temporary replacement after my LG Nexus 5 died. This was supposed to hold me over until I could figure out a real phone to purchase. My expectations were extremely low for such a cheap device. I opted for the $60 version since it had twice the memory and RAM as the $50 one. This was a good move and something I HIGHLY encourage you to do if you get this device.As I unboxed the phone and held it for the first time I couldn\u2019t believe this was a budget phone. It has a slightly curved Gorilla Glass display that gives it a real premium feel. I had it up and running in just a few minutes as it accepted my T-Mobile SIM card without issue. The phone ships with Android Marshmallow and BLU claims they may update it to Android N in the near future. Speaking of T-Mobile, it does not support Band 12 for their extended range LTE service yet. According to BLU, this will be resolved in a future over-the-air software update. Don\u2019t worry, though, 4g LTE is blazing fast on it. Spec wise it is fair, actually pretty comparable to my LG Nexus 5. It runs most games without problems, even more intense 3D games such as Real Racing 3 (that does lag a little but is totally playable).Breaking this down to pros and cons:Pros:$60Running current Android softwareDecent performance and specsGreat solid feelAwesome battery lifeBright and clear displayGood GPS signal locksSolid cell signal receptionExpandable memory with SD card slotDual SIM$60 \u2013 worth mentioning againCons:Slower than some of the more premium phonesSomewhat low pixel density (but not really that noticeable)Touchscreen could be a little more sensitive/responsiveCamera quality is not that goodSub-par built-in speakerNo NFC, compass or 5ghz WiFi capability (2.4ghz WiFi works great though)Regarding the Amazon Prime version\u2026 Yes, there are ads on the lock screen\u2026 and ONLY the lock screen. If you don\u2019t have any notifications on your tray, the ad is full screen until you unlock the phone. If you have notifications, the ad is much smaller and appears just as another notification with \u201cad\u201d specified in front of it. I always have current weather conditions on my notification tray, so I only see the small ad. This is not a big deal. If you so choose, the ads will be relevant to your shopping history on Amazon, so useful things will appear. This is how Amazon brings the price down for this phone. Otherwise, it\u2019s $110. A $50 savings to deal with a small ad on my lock screen is worth it to me. You won\u2019t see any other ads on the device. It does come with some Amazon apps pre-installed but those can be disabled if you choose. There\u2019s also a default Amazon Prime widget on one of the home screens that you can also remove. I should point out a recent software update pushed out by BLU appears to have eliminated the work-around some users of this phone had to get around the lock screen ads. Installing a third-party lock screen no longer bypasses the built-in one.Summary: After spending a week with my new device I have already decided I won\u2019t be shopping for a new one any time soon. I am so impressed with BLU that I will be keeping this phone and pocketing the extra $740 I\u2019m saving by not getting the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (maybe I\u2019ll take a vacation with that extra money instead). Sure, there are some features sacrificed to save money, but don\u2019t let any of that scare you away.",

Super easy, I have Net10 service - it works perfect.The phone itself is beautiful, for the price you can't beat it at all. It has the nice curved screen, the phone is light weight, it is thin, and the screen is big. The speed of the phone is great, everything loads quickly, never freezes, and everything streams flawlessly. I have had 0 issues so far with any of the apps I have downloaded, shows I have watched, or using any social media platforms I have used. For the price, you can NOT beat it. I wasn't expecting a lot out of a phone this cheap, but I am blown away with how nice it is, the look of it, how fast it is, and how great it works.",

It has the apps I need to be productive and connect with friends and family. I started a new job and they have a BYOD policy however, the app used for work mail has not been set up to connect with Windows Phones (Windows does have the app). So now I have this phone just to get work emails. With all of that said, this is a good phone I have no issues, however... with AT&T; getting rid of 2G, the second SIM slot is useless.

Sometimes I need tap 3-5 time for an action to take effect.One more problem is the volume.

    "text": "Initially, I was pleased with both the phone and the quality. With the exception of a few minor disturbances, the phone has done well especially for the price. Decent graphics, good processing power, expandable storage - all good things.A few issues with the phone: battery does not accurately display percentage. It can go from 95% to 75% in a matter of minutes, then stay at 75% for a half hour under heavy use. Secondly, the speaker in the back is extremely sub - par, barely loud enough to hear while in your palm in a room with normal ambient noise. Lastly, after the six month mark, the phone started acting strange. Upon startup, the phone would often enter apps, go into the phone, start calls, make texts - all while I was not touching a thing. A tech friend said it was not spyware or malware, so we are still baffled as to the reason why.My biggest issues happened after 8 months. A wireless update suddenly caused my phone to become almost entirely useless - error messages popping up every second. Calling customer service, they were incredibly unhelpful, frequently asking me to hang up and call back (not sure if they have a time need to complete calls in?) Tech service was absolutely no help.Additionally, upon asking to send it back, I received an email I would have to ship it back, then wait to hear if they would replace it under warranty. If not, I need to pay for them to ship it back - all of this is understandable. The part that is not is that it will take a minimum of 15 days for them to review it, but possibly a minimum of 20 days to do so. This is for a determined software issue on the phone.Overall, it is decent bang for the buck, but it's like a cheap car - great until it breaks, then completely useless.",

It was shipped directly from Amazon, and took a day and a half to arrive, one day before expected arrival date.  My initial impression was that the phone looked and felt pretty good and appeared to be built well.  The back cover did feel a little flimsy, and putting it back on after inserting the sim was a little more difficult than removing it.  The phone does come with a lot of Amazon apps which is to be expected, since it's specifically designed to promote Amazon.  They can't be uninstalled, but many can be disabled in \"settings\" to free up memory.  Android 6 is the installed O.S., but unless there are security issues, I don't care.  Setup is easy, the phone is working well, and feels pretty responsive.  It comes with a 8 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera, so you're not going to get professional pics, but again, it's not a need of mine, so I'm not bothered by it.  I've had it less than 5 hours, so I can't speak of it's longevity.  I may change my opinion of this phone, if it craps out on me in the next few months, but for now, I think this phone is great and well worth the money.",

Like some of the new features though.  This is a great lower cost phone.  I had no real issues with the first, except for to little space on it.  So the larger space makes it perfect.  The only issue I have is the calendar is still not what I would like.  I am a person who likes order and after having a windows phone for many years, and a great helpful calendar, I miss it.  I don't  miss not being able to get alot of apps I couldn't get on the Windows phone.  Love this phone.",

I use this side buy side with my Samsung s7 and don't really care about the differences that much and I'm a smartphone power user. Multitasks fine, camera is ok (not amazing but not bad) and it has reasonable battery life (I get one day max of heavy use).",

After a couple of days of using it though, it's just not enough room for someone who loads a fair amount of apps.EDIT 6/19/2017I have been on the phone with customer service for almost 30 minutes now. I purchased a R1 HD from Amazon in March. It died after five weeks. I sent it back, they offered a replacement, a *BLACK* replacement. I received a *GOLD* one. I would NEVER have agreed if it was gold, and I never would have bought the phone if the only color available was gold. The phone already has lower specs than my original. This is my first experience with Blu, and so far it has not been a good one. I will be telling my friends and family about my experience and warning them to stay away from Blu products.",

I've never had a phone with a flashlight before, or such lightning speeds! If you had a fancy phone before this one, it might be a step down but I practically cried tears of joy when I streamed an episode of Doctor Who on it, plus it had zero lag. I couldn't even watch Youtube on my old phone. It has a lovely responsive screen. The only thing I don't like is when I bought a case for it, it was very hard to press the buttons on the side, but obviously that's not BLU's fault. All in all, great phone, and great price!",

I got it 2 days before vacation, went to Verizon to hook it up, and IT WON'T WORK WITH VERIZON!I called amazon for a no hassle return, and am in the process of sending it back. Of course that means no phone for vacation. When I told the amazon guy that I was disappointed he said it was listed in the description that it wouldn't work with verizon. So I re-read the entire thing, and I never saw that. Now, even though I am getting a no hassle return, I feel lied to. There are several references to \"choose your own carrier\" \"use any carrier or plan\" etc. All I want is for amazon to specifically list that this phone IS NOT compatible Verizon so no one else is as disappointed.",

    "text": "This phone is both amazing and tragic.  It's shockingly good for the price.  Congratulations and admiration to Amazon for a mutually beneficial concept that comes so close to genius.  Amazon gets their presence and ad control in your life through this device, and you get a deal that's almost too good to be true on a cell phone that in some ways holds it's own against the current model Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. The display is bigger, sharper, and brighter than the iPhone 6 display.  It's a far more pleasant and enjoyable display to look at and interact with compared to the iphone 6.  The Amazon presence is not obtrusive.  It's far less of a problem than what I had imagined.  Unless you are neurotic, it's not going to be a problem for you.  I hardly notice it. There is no gyroscope/accelerometer so it's not the right phone for VR apps, yet that's not my problem with it.It's relatively easy to root this device, and unlock the bootloader.  This would allow you to cut your ties with Amazon and remove all the bloatware.  It also opens the door to the possibility of installing the OS of your choice, such as CyanogenMod. I typically would not support doing anything like this, and neither should you,  as it's not ethical considering how and why this phone is being offered at such a low price, and like I said, the trade-off Amazon is providing is a deal not worth being an unethical dick over.  However, there's the camera.  The camera takes blurry pictures.  Unacceptable blurry pictures if you do not have a very steady hand.  I'm so frustrated and let down by this that in some ways, I've lost my sense of loyalty to Amazon - and now say \"have at it\" as far as hacking this phone goes. It is currently not at all difficult to engineer, a inexpensive 8MP camera that takes sharp, clear pictures  There are many out there.  Why they chose this one is beyond me.  Every time I take a picture, despite how much effort I put into setting up the shot with the right settings and despite using a rock-steady hand, it turns out blurry.  It's so maddening, I don't quite know how to put it into words. The CIA should throw out waterboarding and simplify the rendition process by giving out  BLU R1 HD cell phones to those enemy combatants that will not dish. It will drive even those with the firmest resolve into a state of hopeless insanity.  It's no way for a human being to live - with this camera.  It was clearly developed by the same engineers that created chinese water torture.  If it was being sold by Google, one would have no other choice than to assume it was a government psy-ops endeavor, to spread depression, possibly increase pharmaceutical sales, and/or influence certain markets or elections.  Yet this is Amazon, my buddy.  My buddy that has let me down.  Fix this Amazon.  BLU needs to get their act together or you should find a new phone to partner with.I'm returning my second R1 HD after holding out hope that maybe I had originally received a lemon.  Not so.UPDATE: See 10/14/16 comment from me, and check out the new pic.UPDATE: 1/2/17 DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Spend a bit more and get something else.  The camera issue is still an issue even though it improved a bit after the update.  I don't know if it somehow it de-evolved or what, but it's taking very poor looking pictures again as of this date.  The far greater problem is the security issues with it.  The malware that is well hidden in this phone takes up system resources and steals your information.  BLU's official response is that they patched the problem with an update, yet the problem is even worse post update.  Google \"BLU HD1 Chinese malware\".  The very worst part of all this is that Amazon is taking no responsibility for this, refuses to take the phone back, even if I offer to buy another more expensive phone.  I'm having to proceed with going to the FTC and the BBB.  I'm also spearheading a class action suit.",

    "text": "Don't buy. it here's why,You might think that 16gb storage and 2gb ram sounds like a great deal for a $50 phones, but I assure it is not.  This phone's semi no edge 720p screen and the relatively sleek look are in fact the only upsides.  The external build quality is relatively cheap but once you consider that it's a $50 it makes sense and it's not hard to work with.  However, the internal build quality is atrocious and consistently fails not just to impress, but to function at all.  The wifi radio is total garbage, I often just turn off wifi and use my data at home because they do not work well.  The battery life is very short even at low screen brightness and when the phone is at 25% or less it almost seems like the RAM can't get enough battery power and it becomes completely unusable.  Responses on the display happen 15 to 30 seconds after you interact with it.  In fact once you are below 25% you can hardly even reboot the phone to fix the issues because if it responds at all it usually just doesn't do anything when you hold the power button except occasionally crash and fix the problem.  As you might expect the camera on a $50 phone is terrible, it makes 5mp look like .5mp images and video come out mediocre at best, but that is far from being it's worst problem. The Blu r1 hd is inconsistent, and the few times it does even work at all is only mildly adequate and is still impossible to use for even the most basic daily operations.  I had high hopes for this phone, and they were most certainly dashed on the rocks.  Just save your money and buy a phone with less cut corners.",

Issue a return request.---A great phone if you're looking for a backup device or are not a heavy user. Has a glass screen, great specs, and it only costs $60 for the higher specced model if you have Prime. Also for those wondering, you don't actually need Prime (or an Amazon account) to use the phone. You can have a friend buy it for you, no problem.However, this phone makes two major compromises which are really annoying: camera and gyroscope. The back camera has a very noticeable shutter lag, and photos almost always come out blurry unless you have incredibly stable hands. The phone also doesn't have a gyroscope, which means no panorama pictures, and no games that involve tilting your phone.If you can live with these limitations or just need a cheap temporary phone, this one is amazing. Otherwise, I recommend going for a higher-priced phone.",

    "text": "****Please people, check the service compatibility. It is right below the pricing of the product. So many bad reviews cannot seem to read and assume this device works on Sprint or Verizon in the USA. READ!****Surprised at the device vs. cost.First thing I want to say is reading all the negative reviews, there are way too many who seem to expect a $60 phone to perform and work as a $600 phone does, Not going to happen. The R1 HD is a BUDGET phone. Heck, I even say it is a BURNER phone. But for the $60 paid it works wonders. **For those who bought the $50 version (1GB RAM/8GB storage) you are at a huge disadvantage. 1GB RAM is far to small for Android 6.x and with only 8GB main storage you will only be able to add a couple apps. Additional memory card foes NOT expand you main storage, only storage for music/photos/videos/etc.**The good points about this phone:1.Almost a stock Android experience. All the additional functions of Samsung/LG/HTC/etc. are not part of Android. They are added by the manufacturer. This is very close to stock Android except for the Amazon apps and a few minor other things.2. Dual SIMs work well for people who need to use this with two different providers. Remember only ONE sim can be used for data. The other can only be used for calls/SMS.3. With T-Mobile I have had no problems using it with data. I even use it as a hotspot and have not had any problems. WiFi and Bluetooth work well for me. Settings for them are straightforward.4. Screen is decent for a $60 phone. Works well indoors and out of direct sunlight.5. Amazon ads ONLY appear on the lock screen. reviews you read from others saying they pop up all the time are incorrect. They are most likely caused by an app they installed that likes to feed full screen ads all the time. This is a user issue, watch, and READ, what you install. Free is not always free.The bad things about this phone:1. Screen is poor in direct sunlight.2. External speaker on the back is set so low you can barely hear it, even on full volume.3. USB port is backwards from all other phones I have ever encountered. Might limit your use with a dock.4. Battery capacity is small. If you are a heavy user this may be a problem for you.5. Support from BLU for Android updates will most likely be non-existent. They have a terrible track record.One final thing. Concerning the Wireless Update app that was determined to be sending info to the marketing company in China. The paranoia runs rampant in the USA. The issue was fixed by BLU. Current phones will use the Google OTA software. Older phones will be using the original OTA software but has been updated to remove the date packet sending. Plus what is some China marketing company going to do with your info? Give it to their government and do what? It's not like Google/Apple/Microsoft don't do the exact same thing to your other devices. Get a grip.This is a fine BUDGET/BURNER phone. If it breaks at least you are not out $600+ for a new one or $200 for a repair. Just buy another or opt for something that can handle your usage and handling.*Update* Added a couple photos with and without the case made for this phone and sold by amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01GIRTG7G/ref=twister_B01I0ZP29U?_encoding=UTF8&psc;=1",

First off, the phone is fast. The 16 GB ROM 2 GB RAM variant works very well. The UI is stock Android 6.0 and is very smooth. As with most people, battery life is a concern. It only has 2500 Mah...but it is very adequate. Because the screen resolution is 720p and 5 inch screen, the battery doesn't drain as much. It lasts just as long as my OnePlus  2 and that has a 3300 Mah battery! Overall, this phone is an excellent buy. The ads are not intrusive at all. If you are addicted to Amazon, then this phone will definitely feed that addiction. By far, this is the best $60 I have ever spent. If you buy this phone, you will not regret it",

    "text": "Purchased this phone after I broke the screen on mine and we did a sim card shuffle with the rest of the phones in the house.  So far, very, very pleased with all aspects of this phone.The price point can't be beat.  We opted for the Prime Exclusive offer which very nearly halved the already more than reasonable price because it would come with the Amazon apps installed and would show ads.  It's worth noting that the ads only show up on the lock screen and you can swipe them away in an instant (though, lets face it, the ads will probably just wind up being enticing).  As far as the apps go, you can disable them, so if you don't really want them, not a very big deal.The phone itself is very light, but it doesn't feel like it's poorly made or like it will break under the barest of pressure. The size and weight are very comfortable in my hand.  The battery cover has a matte feel (if that sort of thing matters to you) and is very light.  In fact, as far as I can tell this is probably the lightest and least weighty part of the phone.  I imagine that the only reason you'd need to have the cover off is to add or remove a sim card (this has dual sim card slots) so I can't see a whole lot of worry that it would break.Screen is sturdy and strong feeling.  Power and volume buttons are on the right side of the phone and are easily depressed and spring back into place, no stickiness.The touch screen responds very well, swiping, scrolling, selecting an app and moving from one thing to the next is pretty seamless.  The resolution on the screen is great and everything shows up clean and clear.Along with the dual sim card capacity I mentioned, the phone comes with 16 GB of storage and has a memory card slot to expand your storage if need be (music anyone?).  The memory card can be formatted in one of two ways, first, would be a your standard memory for various media, such as photos and files, etc (you can then swap this media card out with others), and the other way would be formatting it to be treated as internal memory(once you've done this you can't swap it out with another phone, your memory card would be good only in this phone).A nice little feature (both generally and as a battery saver) that comes with the phone is the ability to schedule power on and off times.  You can set times for the phone to automatically shut itself down and eventually to power itself back on.  Great if you want to conserve battery power over night and still be able to have your phone turn back on to use the alarm for waking up.SInce the phone is unlocked it's perfect for BYOP type services but is also compatible with most service providers out there, all you need to do is pop in your sim card.The camera is the one drawback, as it is not quite as high quality as the rest of this phone, but make no mistake, it takes a good picture.  Just not as good as you're used to if this is a downgrade for you.  Overall though, I don't find that this changes the way I feel about the phone because I'm still capable of taking a really decent picture with it.",

    "text": "I had a day to play with the ad-free version.The good.Surprising build quality, not just for a cheap phone, but in general. You pick it up, and it feels nice and rigid, not too light, not too heavy, without any ugly materials.The price, obviously. Hard to beat, near impulse buy territory.Specs - while nothing special, you get a full package in a nice looking device, with no dealbreaking compromises for most budget users. Best or close to best performance in the price range.The not so good.The small speaker on the back is mediocre, or passable at best. Not a loud one, but as a ringer/notifier gets the job done.The headphones output is not all that loud either. Its quality is alright, but the volume level was below my other devices. Keep that in mind when choosing headphones to pair with this phone.There have been some issues with Band 12 on T-Mobile in certain areas. You'll receive a software update that is somehow supposed to fix it, although reports point that experience may vary. Probably nothing critical, but do your research.Android 6.0, which is not likely to get any major OS updates. Wasn't as big of a deal, when it came out last year. The only reason why it's not a 5 star review. At least it's close to stock Android.The expected.The display. Nothing wrong with it, all things considered. Could've been on a high-end device few years ago, but today just a solid 720p LCD, which doesn't give away the price. Personally, I'm thankful that it's a 5\" display, since I'm not particularly fond of larger screens.The camera. Well... as long as you have *plenty* of light, you can get decent pictures out of it. Not as usable in dim conditions (I'll attach a few examples). Front camera could've had a wider angle, but will do the job for video chats with a beam of light on your face, and that's about it. When it comes to video, don't get your hopes high - we're not yet at the point where low budget smartphones shoot nice looking videos.No support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi, but again, that's expected. Most won't notice.The battery is not exactly of a high capacity. But given the mild power consumption of the CPU and the display, it should be enough for typical daily use.The conclusion.Still one the best offers in the price range, if not the best. Even for the $110 ad-free version. Go for the 2GB RAM version.Can make someone happier than what it costs.Also, a great backup phone. Did I say it looks and feels nice?",

    "text": "This is a great budget phone made even better with the Amazon Prime exclusive price point. $50 for a phone with specs along the lines of flagships from the past few years is just insane. I cherished and babied my LG G3 all that I could, but that couldn't stop it from getting its screen cracked, suffering from bad battery life and up-and-dying on me a month ago. But there is where the BLU R1 HD came in. Sure, it isn't the top of the line most HD, ram-filled, octuple-cored-badass-phone on the market, but it doesn't have to be. That QHD screen on my LG? I barely made use of it; never streamed content in anything higher than 720p just because my internet isn't fast enough and I don't have a data plan hearty enough to do such a thing. The 32GB of storage? Never filled it; I have a micro SD for that. 3GB of RAM\" Doubt my casual use every pushed that to it's limit.Point of the matter is that all these nice, fancy phones on the market are expensive and overrated. I didn't NEED a QHD screen, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but I got it because I heard nice things about the phone. Sure, I liked it, but the phone bit the bullet way to quickly. Hell, it bit the dust before it was even finished being paid off!The BLU R1 HD doesn't have all the bells and whistles we've become accustomed to, and that is exactly what I like about it. For $50, I got a phone. A GOOD phone. It has stellar battery life, expandable storage, two SIM card slots, Android 6.0, both front and rear facing cameras and is unlocked out of the box. That's enough for me, and way more than I expected for just one Ulysses S. Grant!Out of the box, the Amazon ads are on the lockscreen, sure. In a way it's a bit creepy. It's definitely a bit annoying. But the smart cookies (myself included) can figure out ways around the ads if they so desire. Most people will likely be fine with them, especially considering the trade off being that you get an entire damned phone out of the deal.The main highlight of the device though - for me at least - has got to be the battery life. Because the phone has a 720p display (which is all you honestly need, come on now), the battery isn't constantly being consumed because it has to power a big, QHD/4K AMOLED-whatever screen. The average charge lasts me well throughout the day, despite having WiFi, Bluetooth and 4G enabled, the screen set to medium brightness, and vibrations all kept at standard settings. The screen on time is surprising, for such a cheap device, and I find that it NEVER gets hot in my hand. It's fantastic, and a wonderful change compared to my old phone that damned near burnt me, killed itself and exploded it's own battery after just 30 minutes of light use.The one and only thing about the BLU R1 HD that I don't like is the really stupid, small and insignificant stuff like the notification LED only being capable of displaying 3 colors (red, green and red-green) and the back camera not being super good (coming from the LG G3, which had probably one of the nicest cameras I've ever used). But in every other field, this phone is absolutely wonderful.Whether or not you need a replacement phone, want a new device, or are just a prime subscriber with 50 bucks and some free time to blow, get this phone!",

The first R1 we had wouldn't connect to our Wifi and download updates; rather it would, but it wouldn't download anything and completely froze up. Upon returning it, I set the new one up for her, but she's had countless issues with it, from texts not going through, to pictures not being able to be sent. I've had almost no issues with my G4, but this little R1 HD has had nothing but.Avoid this and spend the extra money on the G4; we're returning our R1 and getting the Moto instead.",

    "text": "There are many user reviews about the Blu R1 HD already posted. I am using mine with Tracfone. I bought a BYOP kit for .98 cents. Plugged in a GSM sim card, that was provided in the kit. I went to Tracfone's site, and plugged in the sim number. Kept my old phone number. It will tell you that it may take up to two days for things to get set up...Well mine was ready to use almost right away. It transferred the airtime, and days of service also that was on my old phone. It was quite easy. Just follow the directions, on their site. If you get hung up, they are a phone call away....Now the phone.  I forgot to mention, I did install a 64 gig Micro SD card. Per the specs, 64 gig is the max it will support. Well I'm quite impressed, so far...The adds on the lock screen, are not a problem for me. A swipe of the finger, and they are out of the way. For the money, I think it's a great phone.",

    "text": "This is really a $60 Phone? Unbelievable.First impression. Good size, sharp and bright IPS screen, quick responses. Metal frame looks and feels really good. Back panel is rubberized feeling, thin as other mainstream phones.My main phone is a LG G5 on monthly plan, bought this one just for using Freedompop's free SIM card services as a backup. However, it's dual SIM card feature cannot have both cards connect to internet. This might not be an issue for a normal prepaid card, but for a data based service like Freedompop, it means you can only have one number online each time. It still got the signal for both, but won't ring. You can switch to either card tho, but it'll still be one card online each time.As I said, I only use it as a backup phone, so not much apps being installed. My girlfriend has used it to play her games. Pokemon Go works flawlessly and very smooth, but for something requiring large 3D processing, it will lag some times. Some people have mentioned about the speaker is not loud enough for music playback, I think it's loud enough to hear the ringtone.Now the big reason for the $50 deduction on price, the Ads. It only appears on the lock screen. and most of them are actually got pretty high definition graphics. I kinda like the way the ads looks, it makes the lock screen more vivid, I don't have to download other lock screen changer or looking at the same lock screen picture forever.I wasn't anticipating much from the phone really. But it offers much more than I'd expected. The system is very close to a barebone Android. Unlike my LG or other name brand android phones I've used (HTC, samsung, etc), this phone is running on a much lighter Android 6.1 (out of box, and being upgraded to 6.6 when I connect to internet). So although it has much worse hardware specs comparing to my Top the Tier G5, it doesn't affect the operation at all.Another thing I like was the camera, I have uploaded 2 photos taken by this phone. It's only 8M pixels, but quality is pretty good. And it has a very unique flash light for front facing camera, yes a real flashlight not like lighten up the screen feature on my LG. This is a good selfie phone. Front camera got wide angle, too. I don't know why other maker don't put a flashlight on the front for selfie lovers.All in all, Great phone for the price. Going to get a good case and screen protector for it.",

    "text": "Note: Do NOT get the 8 GB version, get only the 16 GB version (read on below).Can't go wrong for $60 for an LTE phone (LTE for USA and much of Latin America--will only get 3G speeds in most of Europe and Asia). It's a perfectly good phone, the Amazon ads are unobstrusive, the screen is very bright and the feel is good. Dual SIM is a great bonus for travellers and rare to find on phones marketed in the US. The GPS sensor is more sensitive (syncs fast and is very responsive) than the BLU Life One that I had previously which is great for this price point. The only negatives are that the speaker sound is very low (e.g., when using speakerphone or for music) and there are no included earphones, silicone case or screen-protector (as in previous BLU phones), but the 16 GB version would still get 5 stars because of the incredible price.The 8 GB version, on the other hand, would get 3 stars only or maybe even 2 stars (since they are part of the same listing, I can only write one review for both of them). It is just plain absurd to have an Android 6 phone with 8 GB internal memory as the OS takes up 6 GB and you're left with 2 GB which you're going to run out of almost instantly. So pay $10 additional for the extra 8 GB and you effectively get 5x more useable memory. An external memory card barely helps. Even if you use the option in Android 6 to \"merge\" the external card with internal memory, they are still maintained separately and some things continue not working when the truly internal memory runs out. The 8GB version is a dud.",

If I am forced to buy another phone, I believe it will be A BLU again.OK to be fair I just received this phone yesterday. I decided to try something different because I am a die-hard LG fan.Out of the box looked great, then downhill kinda.The back is very flimsy. Whoever made it put snaps all the way around because they knew how flimsy it was. Would have been nice to just make a better backing. I def DO NOT like that the battery is built in. So when my charger port breaks as usual (the reason I have this phone) I will be forced to buy another.The charging took FOREVERRR. Finally after 3 hours it was on 70% . I couldn't take it so I went and plugged in my $5 family dollar cord and bam 45 minutes later done! I went to bed with a charge of 80% woke up with 14% HOW!!Yeah I don't know about this I will give it about 2 weeks and update u. Quality has nothing to do with the price.

    "text": "Loved the phone while it worked but it has now died in under 6 months. The other day I was cooking dinner when I look over at the counter and see the phone rebooting on it's own. Screen comes up looking scrambled and is completely unusable. Attempt to reboot it and I can't even get it to turn on again. Tried for a bit to revive it after dinner and was able to get it start back up for about 2min before it turned off again. I haven't been able to even get it to turn on since then.==============Edit: 3 April 2017Revised down to 1-star and customer service has been useless. I've explained the phone doesn't turn on three times at this point and they continue sending me instructions that can only be followed for a phone that can power on. Now they're asking for the same information as originally sent in using their online form from their website. I don't expect much from customer support these days but this is ridiculous and marching into absurdity.",

They would be right. They would also say that the camera is crappy and sound is tinny. They would also be right. But it's quick enough, screen is sharp, and the Amazon offers/ads do not get in the way. Honestly, if you wanted better screen/sound/camera, you would need to pay extra.You can lift off the backplate of the phone, no problem. But I'm not sure if the battery is user-replaceable a la LG; it's taped up with stickers and I have no idea how the contact area is.Note: the phone takes microSIM, not a full SIM nor a nanoSIM. Strange design decision for sure.Also, if you disable the Amazon app, your phone will ring constantly whenever a new offer/ad pops up. I know it sounds like it may take some memory space, but if you value your sanity, don't disable that one app. You can disable others (e.g. Amazon Music, Audible) just fine, though. Again, the ads are not intrusive and, hey, you might actually want something in the app.Another odd design decision: the microUSB port is installed backwards. Why?",

    "text": "Had this phone for approximately 2 months, it fell from about pocket height onto the ground and the screen shattered however. This was obviously my fault, not an issue with the phone, but certainly don't count on the screen being particularly resilient.I'd agree with most of the main points others have brought up in their reviews - It's fast enough, it looks decent, and it's a nice, fairly stock Android OS that comes installed. I WILL say that after about 1 month, the phone had started to really slow down. This happens with all phones after they've been in use for awhile to accumulate a bunch of cached data and background processes, but it was VERY noticeable with this phone.The main reason I did not purchase another one as a replacement is that the Blu R1 HD utterly, steadfastly REFUSES to maintain a solid Bluetooth connection. I tried everything, including wiping network settings, removing interference, testing multiple Bluetooth devices, etc...nothing worked. The phone would disconnect, or refuse to connect entirely, or I'd see \"Connected: (No Media)\" or even \"Connected: No Phone\" in the Bluetooth settings when I pulled them up.Blu had to cut corners SOMEWHERE, and clearly they went with the absolute cheapest, flimsiest Bluetooth hardware they could find, If you connect a lot of Bluetooth accessories to your phone, you will HATE this one.Also, to proactively cut off any stock responses from Blu saying something like \"Oh, well this is unusual, please contact us with your IMEI so we can file a cliam to resolve this highly unsual, not-at-all-common problem with your phone!\" - Just search for the keyword \"Bluetooth\" in the 6,000+ reviews that have been left for this item - Virtually everyone who mentions Bluetooth in their review brings it up in the context of the Bluetooth function not working correctly. It's not a one-off issue, this model of phone has fundamental Bluetooth issues.",

I need to troubleshoot this; it may simply need an update or something.-Camera is meh, though not terrible-Placement of hard buttons (on/off and volume) makes accidental activation likelyMy previous phone (now retired for use as a mini-tablet) was a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It still functions, but the USB/charge port has died, and as I'm about to embark on a long solo road trip, I wanted inexpensive phone I could charge while driving.I should mention up front that I very rarely talk on the phone, so that particular functionality isn't really a priority for me. That said, I used my BLU R1 HD to complete the initial consultation for an upcoming medical appointment, and except for the fact that my face hit \"end call\" midway through (a problem I have had with every single touchscreen phone I've ever used if I don't think to activate the screen lock or use speakerphone or a headset), the call went just fine. Audio quality was perfectly acceptable, and the staff at the medical practice had no difficulty understanding me.Now, on to more important features!Coming from the Note series with a Wacom-driven stylus, I was concerned that I'd find swipe-typing on the BLU R1 HD annoyingly imprecise. I'm pleased to report that my concerns were unfounded. Using the standard gBoard, texting and typing on the BLU R1 HD are painless. I normally use SwiftKey, but haven't installed it on the new phone, as I'm pretty satisfied with gBoard. I have now written entire blog posts on my new phone with surprising ease.The precise responsiveness that makes texting a breeze carries over to other applications as well. I've been using a game called Mr. Catt to feel out casual gaming capabilities, and the BLU R1 HD's manageable size, crisp graphics, and responsive touchscreen make for a really enjoyable gaming experience.Reading ebooks and web content is also pleasant and painless.Meanwhile, Amazon's ad content is unobtrusive. Lockscreen ads are fairly tame (no animations to eat your data), and the can shunt the remaining ad widget to a secondary screen. I'm running Google Now Launcher, and I've bumped the Amazon ad widget over three screens.The BLU R1 HD does to have have few weaknesses, however.First, Bluetooth is iffy\u2014it has crashed two out of the three times I've used it. I normally use Bluetooth quite a lot to stream audio to external speakers, so that's troublesome. I have not, however, checked to see if it need an update or something.Second, the camera isn't great, and it does tend to lend a blue cast to images. On the other hand, it's not terrible either, and for $60 I really can't complain.Third, the of the power button and volume rocker takes some getting used to. This may be because I'm coming from a slightly larger phone with a different setup, but I keep hitting one or of them when I my phone. On the other hand, a different case\u2014one with recessed openings of raised covers\u2014could help with that.Overall, at full price ($110 for the model I bought), the BLU R1 HD is a solid, workmanlike device. It may not offer all the bells and of higher-end devices, but for a budget it touches all the bases with surprising success.",

That first SIM card lasted about one month before it burned out and I couldn't make calls, texts, or use internet outside of Wifi.T-mobile was great and replaced it for me. I have had the second new SIM for about a month. Today, I got another message saying I couldn't send messages or calls.I am hoping it is just the one phone that I bought, but I won't know until I can get a replacement.Otherwise, the usage for this as a little mini computer at home has been speedy and easy.Update, 3 hours later: The sound went out on this. I'd say completely, but that's not quite true. Sometimes, randomly, it has been screeching a bizarre noise out when I have been using it. It is not specific to any apps. It has screeched far louder than the calls or podcasts ever played AND screeches even when the sound is completely muted. This caused me to look more closely at the reviews since I purchased it. I believe the battery over heating is causing my SIM card to get burned. That the customer service rep could not replace the SIM card for me today, that the phone burned, is disappointing. I wasted over $80 on this phone, between the phone, the screen cover, the SIM card, and the case.",

    "text": "I got this phone for my 70-year-old mother who wanted to step into the smart phone world mainly for Facebook, Amazon shopping, and navigation. The drivers for me were the price and the pre-loaded Amazon apps. I got the 16GB device. For only $10 more, the better specs seem worth it. My mom loves shopping on Amazon and using this phone  today she made her first purchase from a mobile device and she was impressed with the simplicity.She loves her Fire TV stick that I got for her this past Christmas and the Amazon Video app brings that simplification to an Android smart phone. It\u2019s such a hoot to see her peruse movies and then click on Prime content and start watching it for free. She wanted me to show her how to use navigation so I downloaded the Waze app and it runs smoothly and switches easily to multiple open applications, including phone calls.  Facebook, gmail, Amazon photo drive\u2026check.I love my Mum but to be honest, she\u2019s not too bright with technology. But she has figured out in only one day how to use this phone, except for the difference between a pre-loaded app and an app in the app store. The cloud confuses her as does the difference between Wi-Fi and cellular. She thought I was lying to her when I told her the price. Then I showed her the device page on the Amazon mobile shopping app. I spent $60. Yes\u2026$60 for a new UNLOCKED Android phone with fairly decent specs.There\u2019s a bit of initial setup as you need to log in to both Amazon and Google to get the full functionality of each, but except for the Amazon logins it\u2019s no more complex relative to any other Android set-up.Audio quality on calls and playing content through the speaker is good. Streaming content looks great on the display. There is a crisp response when moving between applications and screens.I\u2019m a veteran of Android and iphones, so for myself I usually carry the high-end devices. But this Blu device can handle work, utility, and entertainment. I have to say this device is a good value, and I can live with the ads that come with it. They are integrated virtually seamlessly as to not be intrusive in the functionality of the device. We\u2019ve only had the thing for a day so I can\u2019t comment on durability or the long-term robustness of the software, but thus far, I can recommend it almost anyone who isn\u2019t a phone snob.",

Amazon was nice enough to give me the $50 credit over the phone, however. The phone is thin, light, doesn't overheat, can run 40+ apps simultaneously, and has a great screen and camera--this is coming from a guy who was running pretty good photos with the Nokia Lumia 1020 with a 41 MP camera. I bought a PERFECT case for it as well ($7/shipped for two cases, \"SPARIN TPU CASE\"). The ads are no big deal--just one of scores of notifications you toss with a swipe of your finger. One thing to know. Just installing your need-to-have apps fills the phone to over 10 GB, so there is NO WAY you could use the 8 GB version. Everyone knows hard drives wear out MUCH faster if they are over 50%, so I bought a $9.99 UHC Samsung 32 GB card to go with it. You can migrate most of your apps over to it with no loss in speed, and I'm currently running about 8 GB on the internal drive.",

People are crazy to waste their money on iPhones when they can get this fine phone that does the same thing, at a substantially  lower price. As other reviews have indicated, the camera is poor quality, but adequate for me. I also have a Nikon for real pictures. The speaker is also kind of weak, but it is good enough with the volume way up. Besides price this phone whips iPhone's tail when it comes to memory. With iPhone if you need more memory, all you can do is throw it away and spend hundreds more for a newer iPhone. With this phone you can just put in a new microSDHC chip up to 64Gb. I got a 32 Gb chip and I am only using 10% of it with all the applications that I want. You can tell it to use the external memory first, so that your internal memory doesn't get used up. Most of the applications that I use came pre-installed. The screen is bright and sharp. WiFiwoks great and remembers locations that I previously signed into and re-connects. I find that I use little cell data with WiFI. I use it with PureTalk USA and I pay relatively little to have and use a really smart phone. I never used texting from a phone before, but the built-in voice to text feature makes it very easy.

    "text": "Well, I'll start by siting the things that I really like about this phone.PROS:Visual appeal of a high-end smartphoneFast loading and swipingEasy to close down multiple appsLots of room for storageFast data speedsComes stock with Google Chrome (and Google everything else)Fast access to Amazon Prime shoppingFast download speeds for appsEase of useSemi-fast charging (do not use any other charger than the one provided to you with the handset. Using any other charger could cause a fire).Easy to transfer SIM data from old phone to this phone via a TRACFONE Sim Kit.CONS:WIRELESS UPDATER TROJAN COMES PRELOADED ON THIS HANDSET! Say what?! Yes...it's true. This is the only reason I'm giving this phone 3 stars. This Trojan is potentially life altering, and not in a warm, friendly, fuzzy, happy, fun way either. What's worse, is I can't remove it from the phone. I've already looked into the research behind this issue, and it has happened to many BLU handset users over the past 2 years. Unfortunately, based upon this research the customer service runaround is intensive, involves 2 to 3 different entities (people you have to talk to to get the issue fixed), and typically ends in your sending the phone back for a refund. You may be wondering how I know it's a trojan, and the answer is simple. I purchased Webroot Antivirus for my computers, desktops, and mobile devices. While scanning the phone for the first time, my PAID subscription of Webroot found this Trojan, and no matter how many times I attempted to quarantine it, it could not be quarantined, deleted, or uninstalled. From what I've read on the matter, it is part of the Google Mobile Updater system, which creates a force updater situation.This trojan is of concern to me, but I've only just begun to use the new BLU handset today after spending an hour and a half switching my carrier service from my old cellphone to this BLU smartphone.I will certainly post updates should they be warranted. For now, just know that this may be an issue for you should you choose to buy this phone. Now, it's important to note that I purchased the Prime Member Special Offer for this phone, which saved me about $50 on the price. Does this trojan come on the \"no amazon ad\" version of this phone? I can't answer that, as I don't know.Aside from this wireless updater trojan issue, I'm relatively happy with my new smartphone! Only time will tell if I remain happy or not.",

    "text": "I bought this phone on \"sale day\", and Amazon delivered it to my doorstep next day. They get 10 stars. The other thing that Amazon has excelled at here is presenting a VERY INEXPENSIVE, BUT SOLID android phone - COMPLETELY UNLOCKED! I have had NO PROBLEMS with the phone (2 months now) since I purchased it, and I have used it daily. The setup was easy (about 15 minutes including updates), and it came with about a 65% battery charge.Second, I initially bought this BLU phone to use as a WiFi phone in combination with an Ooma Hub I keep in my home office, and then consider a full service carrier at some time in the future. It is a perfect match. I simply downloaded the Ooma app from Google Play, and used it in place of the standard phone app within Android 6.0, and logged into my Ooma account. It worked perfectly on the first call.Third, the overall phone is VERY good. It is fast enough, BUT I am glad that I bought the 16 GB phone for $10 more (not the 8 GB phone), because Android and the apps that Amazon install take up nearly 5GB! My strong recommendation is just get the 16 GB phone. The 5 inch screen crisp and clear (720P), rocker buttons on the side are accessible enough, and the phone memory is expandable up to 64 GB. The phone back cover separates easily to access all the necessary slots for extra memory and cell service chip sets. Honestly, for $60, this phone cannot be beat - especially unlocked!Fourth, for those that might be concerned, the Amazon ads are NOT a big deal. When you turn on the phone, they come up on the lock screen. All you need to do is swipe up once, and you are in. There is also an ad window on the second screen of the phone which seems permanent, however this can be moved if needed. I simply created a third screen (page) and moved the ad window and all the Amazon related apps to that 3rd screen. This way I have the first two screens (pages) for necessary app's I use and their icons. More pages can also be added (e.g., for any app addicts reading this), if needed.Finally, I can't give this BLU phone anything less than five stars because it works perfectly for what I intended it to do - which was to start using it immediately, test it as an inexpensive WiFi phone AND then later (possibly) expand to a full service carrier. It works great and came fully unlocked (no tricks). If you are particular about your phones (like quality speakers) or service carrier (e.g., you only use Verizon), you certainly may not like this phone. So peacefully go somewhere else and buy the phone you want, OK?. However, if you want to save A LOT of money on your next phone purchase OR avoid the hassles of service contracts, this unlocked phone works great and in many scenarios (e.g., Wifi, Tracfone, full service carrier)!",

    "text": "4-6-17 UPDATE to my review.  Ok after the 1st one broke and they wanted $50 to \"maybe\" repair it, I just went ahead and brought another one.The 2nd one has now died after 7 short months.  These phones are good as long as you don't mind getting a new one every time it stops working - it is more like a 6-8 month disposable phone. I'm done - not worth my time & energy replacing it again.I brought this phone for my son in July. We liked it very much since he could access all of our prime stuff from it. However, he dropped it and it cracked immediately, I said oh well you will have to just have a cracked phone because he could still use it since the crack wasn't too bad.  within 2 weeks the crack spread and the phone started acting up, wavy lines and black areas, so now it is no longer usable. of course this happened 3 DAYS AFTER my return period of Aug 13. I am going to order another one, and the case will remain on it at ALL times. this phone is very fragile, be very careful with it. I have had many phones and never had one break this fast.",

    "text": "I placed an order for one BLU R1HD \"Used-like new\", but unfortunately the phone that I received, came with serious problems in both SIM Slots: SIM-Card-1 and also SIM-Card-2The problem with the SIM-Card-Slot-1 is that the metal clip that secures the SIM1, on one of its 2 sides is broken and totally loose, and also its gray plastic frame (where SIM1 card is placed), arrived broken and also very worn on the sides ... So unfortunately, the SIM comes out by itself and therefore never connects with the 8 contacts of the slot.The problem with SIM-Card-Slot-2 is that although the metal clip that secures the SIM2 is in place and is not loose, unfortunately its gray plastic frame (where the SIM2 card is placed), also arrived broken and very worn on both sides, same as the SIM-Card-Slot-1, not allowing to close the metal clip that should hold in place the SIM card.So, it seems that perhaps this cell phone was heavily used or mistreated previously, because both SIM card slots are very worn, and in addition the metal clip of the SIM-Slot-1 card came broken and totally loose!If you want some proof of this problem just have to see the photos I just uploaded...As I mentioned before, there is no way to keep the SIM card connected, and unfortunately I can not place my SIM card on any of the two available SIM card slots, since both metal clips that should hold the SIM card in place do not close and always are kept open.Unfortunately this annoying problem, makes this cellphone totally unusable, because the SIM is never recognized (NO SIM) by the Android System Tools Bar, and therefore no phone calls can be made!So be very careful when ordering these used phones, because as it happened to me, you could receive a damaged cellphone!I'm going to contact amazon to explain this problem and see if they can help me...",

When walking on the street, the audio would break up on my headsets at random intervals, as if affected by wifi networks. It was not an issue with my headsets; they function perfectly with other phones and tablets I have paired them with. I contacted Blu tech support, who were rather clueless and prescribed perfunctory measures that didn't work. I ordered a replacement phone from Amazon, same make and model. And the issue was reproduced. I insist: the headsets are perfectly ok an work well with any other device. I believe this is a design flaw.I am returning this second unit, and won't be ordering a replacement. I'll go back to my old Galaxy Nexus. Ancient, but bluetooth-reliable.",

Expect the crash of both apps. But if you need a phone for just calls and texting and maybe some video watching, then this is a 5 star phone for you. It's not that powerful...

It was difficult to get all SMS settings to work at all, and they are still spotty, often delayed by a day. I know this isn't the phone's fault, but it is a compatibility issue with TMobile. And then there was the BLU Chinese firmware SPY issue, where the phone would forward texts to the Chinese Mother Ship every 72 hours... Couldn't take the battery issue finally, and got a free Samsung On 5; it lasts 3 days. I keep the BLU turned off, and only use it with my second number infrequently.

I'm gonna get a second for a spare.I recommend the BLU R1 HD ArmorFlex Case; it's as good as the Spigen I have on my Samsung S5.64GB Micro SD Compatibility an issue:First, if you don't buy Sandisk or Samsung from a real sales channel, like DIRECTLY from Amazon (as opposed to one of their affiliates), you run an exceptional chance of getting a counterfeit.

    "text": "I'm really liking this phone have had it a little over a week now. I really needed o phone because the one I had just wasn't acting right. Some time last year I was complaining about my then phone which was a Windows phone & struck up a conversation with this lady whose phone I admired for how big it was compared to mine.She went on to tell me it was a BLU phone, how much she loved it from it's storage to how big the screen was even how she didn't have to lock not to dial someone like mine was.This BLU phone has lots of space ,I like the design, it can hold up to two sim cards plus has a slot for an SD card. Installing everything is easy except keep the Sim card in place.it doesn't click or lock it in place you can't just slide it in like some other phones this you have to lift up the thingy then place the card in but then it want go all the way down to lock it in place have to put the back on to keep it there.besides that everything is cool. I got this on sale at Amazon so comes with some added features connected to The Amazon Store. Will update in another month to see if still like it or not.  UPDATEI wish I could give it a 21/2* but 3* have to do.Well although I love the fun overall it's been acting up for the past few months cutting off at random, battery life draining abnormally fast just irritating stuff like When I go to answer a call it just cuts off or in the middle of a conversation it's just shuts off then says it's 0% battery life but when turned on the screen says 24-30%. I'm calling in to see if this problem can be fixed because I haven't had this for even 6 months bump a year & the first half of that it started acting up. Plus It will go to like a system page where it's hard to get out of you can't use your phone you can't turn it off nothing. It's just a headache. Besides all that the storage is great, the volume can use a little work.I ultimately had to send this phone back because even after contacting the company, factory resetting it continued to do the same thing cutting off  not allowing me to be able to talk or anything without it being on a charger or else it would just cut off no matter how much of battery life it had.",

Band 12 support and VoLTE support was \"added\" via a software patch in November, however, VOLTE implementation was not correct and does not function.  After multiple appeals to customer support, the best response I've gotten is that a patch will correct this problem within 30 days.  I bought this phone after support was said to be added, so in many places I do not have Voice and Texting capabilities as this phone does not support VoLTE as it promises.If you are not using this phone on T-Mobile or MetroPCS, then it would be a great phone I'm sure.

    "text": "I can't believe this thing works as well as it does for its price.The screen is perfectly good, the device is VERY lightweight, and the durability is improved drastically due to the lack of mass. I have dropped this thing dozens of times, sometimes even accidentally kicking it down a cobblestone road or into a wall trying to reflexively catch it with my phone, and the screen doesn't even have a single scratch, let alone any cracks. The back cover also shows almost no damage whatsoever, although if you inspect carefully you will find a scratch or two here and there but due to the design and material it barely shows at all. Overall the device is constructed very well, despite not having a removable battery, but this is not a huge concern for such a cheap device.The ads are on the lockscreen only, and are completely non-intrusive. They are pretty much the same half dozen ads over and over, so eventually you just get used to them and completely ignore them, they are just wallpapers on your lockscreen. Of course, you can also root the phone and get rid of them, but then you may run into issues such as not being able to run Pokemon Go, which is the main reason I bought the phone as my main device is Windows and does not have Pokemon.Pokemon Go runs okay. The phone meets the absolute minimum requirements to run the game, but unfortunately as the game has updated lately it has become more and more difficult to run the game reliably. I run into crashes very frequently (probably from running low on system memory), and lag a bit in some menus and especially gyms/raids, but overall it's perfectly good if you just need something cheap to get you by. As the game continues to update and add further generations, it may become less useful for this purpose, but for now it's still workable.One consequence of using this as a PoGo machine is that I am absolutely demolishing the battery life. At first, the battery life was incredible, and the phone would go all day on a single charge playing the game constantly. Now, it's not so great, but I have not quite done my very best to maintain the battery (i.e. charging it when it reaches <40-50% charge rather than running it to down below 10% and then getting home and charging).Overall, 9/10, would buy again for a spare Pokemon phone if I happened to break or lose it somehow. Awesome job, Blu.",

Phone calls are crisp and clear and 4G Lte reception has been strong from a tower a couple miles away. All in all this is a very solid phone for the price point.

    "text": "Overall for the price, Yes its a decent phone. The quality of the phone and the way it looks is great. I bought this phone as a replacement for my damaged iphone. Below i will pin point my review...PROS:CHEAP!Crisp display (Shockingly better then most phones out there)Battery life (I am a big web surfer and i can say this thing can pack a good charge)Camera ( Again, I was shocked how well the pictures looked on this phone. Both front and back)Doesn't feel cheap ( Clean feel and a nice bezel around the phone)SD CARD: Clearly this is a MUST! if not, you wont last DUE TO HIGH ANGERCONS:Processor - could possibly be the WORST android phone i have ever put my hands on. App's loading time are nervewrecking. Call pick ups lag and it wont accept the call due to the SLOWNESS of this phone. Texting, I don't even want to write about it (ITS HORRIBLE)PAUSE LOADING THEN CRASH- if you quickly go to the notification bubble on the locked screen. it will crash the phone. EVERYTIMEOVERHEATING - the phone gets hot extremely fast. this makes the slowdown even worst and constant app crashing on basically everythingAMAZON ADS- Yes its small pop up ads that only come up on the load screen. BUT, During my testing of this phone i notice my data fairy went up extremely quick. Also the ad's are causing this phone to run on its last bit of memory. AMAZON app's seriously take up about 85% of the of the phones internal memory.  Best thing about it? You can't delete ANY of them.Screen- It cant handle out of pocket use! I basically placed a return and hoping it goes through. but with about a week and a half of use. This unit cant handle out not pocket use without scratches.For the price this is a awesome basic phone for like a true beginner to the smart phone community. It will get the job done and a bit more. But for me a person that is a social media guru. Stay away! I didn't have high hopes for this phone and i took it easy on her. Still it was as bad as i thought.",

    "text": "Well to me it's good for a backup phone for when your expensive phone is sick or temporary unavailable. Why because the speaker volume and ear is too low. They should both have a nice loud volume on high so we can hear people. Next, the on off button presses too easily, who wants to keep getting that reboot or safe mode screen. Next some apps won't work because it keeps saying turn off over lay screen, who wants to keep doing that. The so called swipe for camera or google voice is difficult to swipe the correct way to acces those features fast. Next my screen freezes a lot. I even had a replacement that did the same thing. It charges slowly.  Camera takes slow pictures so for get catching a fast moment. The apps where you can fill out PDF forms do work on this phone. And phone can get hot fast too. All the free up space alerts are annoying. And phone's ring settings change easily without you even knowing. Also I have cricket and I didn't get most of my phone calls if the caller didn't leave a text or a voicemail I would not know they called. But when I put sim back in my iPhone I receive all my calls. So something is definitely going on with the phone. There's more things too but I don't feel like thinking what they are right now. So for 60 bucks this is what you're gonna get for a smart phone. Take it or leave it, at least the inventor tried to make it almost comparable to a high priced smart phone for the people who can't afford the real thing....BUT come on BLU \"not getting all your calls is horrible. \" At least fix that issue.AlsoI put my SIM card back in my iPhone and I'm gonna sit the Blu to the side for when my iPhone dies on me at 30%. I wish APPLE would fix that issue because I LOVE My IPHONE ...Don't compare the Blu to an iphone because you won't be happy.",

    "text": "Amazon has done us Prime members a great service by having a Prime Day. I took advantage of the sale and pre-ordered the BLU R1HD phone.  For $59.95, I think I got a bargain. A phone with 2GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage cannot generally be bought for this price. Having to view an ad to receive a $50 discount is a small price to pay. My Kindle Fires have the lockscreen ads and I\u2019ve saved quite a bit on books and other items presented for sale that I might not have known about. I expect to do the same with this phone. The BLU RD 1 HD upon unboxing feels like a mid-priced Samsung phone (i.e. Samsung J3) in your hand. The plastic back snaps off just like a Samsung phone and here\u2019s where I had a slight problem.IMPORTANT: This phone has dual sims as well as a slot for a micro-SD card. I glanced at the diagram in the tiny instruction book but didn\u2019t read the instructions as I should have. I attempted to insert the sim card in the Sim 1 slot just below the camera lens. It didn\u2019t want to slide in. Something didn\u2019t seem right. I checked the instruction booklet and got my reading glasses out and discovered that the sim slots open up. You slide them up in the case of the sim 1 slot, or slide it towards the camera with the sim 2 slot about \u00bc of an inch and flip the bottom edge up. You can then lay the sim card in place and then close the sim slot cover and move it \u00bc inch back. My Samsung phones never had this type of sim setup.My phone\u2019s battery came charged at 69% and before I did anything with it, I let it charge to 100% There is an LED next to the earphone speaker at the top of the phone that lights up red while it\u2019s charging and then turns green when it\u2019s charged to about 95% or more. I added a 64 GB PNY micro-SD card and applied a Klear Cut screen protector to the front glass. With Android 6.0 you can have the phone use your micro-SD card as internal storage, a nice feature. So in theory, you could drop a 128 GB micro-SD card into the phone convert it to internal memory and you\u2019d probably never run out of storage space.I tested the Mediatek 6735 processor with a couple of benchmarks:Antutu 6.1.4  31717Geekbench 3  Single core 590  Multi-Core  1602From what I read about this processor, it\u2019s a bit faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 but slower than a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615. I\u2019m not much of a gamer, but I suspect something like Asphalt 8 will play just fine on it.The rear 8 MP camera seems to take decent photos. It not going to be as good as a camera in a flagship phone, but it\u2019ll do in a pinch. The 5 MP with flash ought to take decent selfies. Unlike many phones these days, the Blu R1 HD has that nice notification/charging  LED on its front face that lets you know you have a new message, or app update.There\u2019s not much in the way of protective cases for this phone. Blu includes a cheap case and screen protector on many models, but didn\u2019t on this one. I ordered a Xeptio cover which is slowly making its way from France.\u00a0Blu R1 HD 4G 2016 Dual SIM TPU case half transparent - TPU cover smartphone Blu R1 HD protective case accessories\u00a0In the last couple of days Amazon got some of Blu\u2019s own rear covers for this model as an add-on item.\u00a0BLU R1 HD ArmorFlex Case + Screen Protector - Black/Black\u00a0It provides half way decent protection and includes a screen protector. It\u2019s a bargain for the price! I ordered Klear Cut screen protectors for my phone.\u00a0BLU R1 HD Screen Protector [6-Pack], Klear Cut - Lifetime Replacement Warranty - Anti-Bubble & Anti-Fingerprint High Definition (HD) Clear Premium PET Cover - Retail Packaging\u00a0I usually buy Mr Shield screen protectors, but they had nothing for this model phone. The Klear Cut protector went on just fine!Who is this phone for? Considering the price, it would be a great first phone for a teen or an older person who is outgrowing a feature phone and doesn\u2019t want to spend the money to get an iPhone 6S or Galaxy S7. This Blu RD 1 HD might be a great backup phone for someone who has a pricey flagship phone. For $59 it\u2019s a no-brainer!!!",

Before the BLU I was using a Moto G (2nd gen) with 8GB of memory and a 32GB Micro SD card. I paid $150 for the Moto G. The Moto G was getting very sluggish and was taking a long time to load programs. The BLU R1 HD has double the RAM (2GB) and twice the internal storage (16GB) of the Moto G. The R1 HD is much faster loading programs and rendering web pages than the Moto G ever was. I miss the front-facing speakers from the Moto G and the \"neon\" ringtone for my alarm clock but that's all I miss. The improved overall performance is worth giving up those two things :)November 2016 updateI am alarmed to learn that this phone had spyware installed on it. This could have been prevented with adequate product testing. I am now much less enthusiastic about the BLU brand. They have lost my trust.",

The phone is very stable in other words the phone has not crashed on me. I use the phone as a phone of course and for media such as books on tape or listening to music, and of course as a planner. The Ads from amazon are not intrusive at all, They lock screen changes alot so I dont get board with the same old thing all the time. There was a lot of talk in the reviews about the camera having issues, I did not notice this at all I made sure and removed the clear packaging material over the camera lens and everything worked. I uploaded a photo that I took to show the quality.The Things I wish were better. The battery life is not the best it gets me through almost a whole day but not quite. I take one a portable lithium charger with me and problem solved. The other issue is there seems to be some lag on WIFI. The last thing is there is not a removable batteryso when  the battery dies you will need  a new phone.I do not regret buying this phone at all and would do so again. I will be buying one for my daughter when her current phone dies",

We took it to our Cricket provider, they checked it out, and stated it would not work with their system.  I had forgotten to order a Cricket chip, another waste of money.  Finally, I had planned to order an extra battery, another waste, battery is built-in and can't be removed.  I have always been very pleased, and still am, with Amazon Prime.",

    "text": "I've had this phone for two weeks and I love it. For the price, it can't be beat. I compare it with my 4 year old flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S3. My minimum criteria was fully met, which included LTE, camera specs comparable to Galaxy S3 (8MP,5MP), 16GB built in storage, 2GB RAM, Quad-core processor, Minimum 4.8 inch screen. Although the phone is not perfect, it is more lovable than my Samsung Galaxy S3, especially for the price, which is why I give it 5 stars.Pros.* The 5 inch screen is beautiful to look at and the rounded glass on the edges make it a delight to hold.The Screen is bright and auto-brightness works great. Text seems easier on my eyes than old Samsung Galaxy S3.* Battery life is great! lasts 1.5 days with heavy use (video watching, audio listening, tethering) and 2 days with normal use. Tethering is quick, flawless, lightning fast LTE (hit 35mbps download!).* Android 6 Marshmallow is buttery smooth. Camera software is feature rich! Cameras have a higher dynamic range than SGS3 and exposure is better, especially on skin tones. I can take panoramic selfies, dual-view pictures that use both cameras at the same time. Wide-angle selfies are very good. In fact, the front-facing camera is significantly better than my old Samsung Galaxy S3.* The phone is sleek, light, and fits just right in my medium sized hand. I love that you can set it to turn on and off on a schedule.Cons.* Media Volume could be louder, but it's acceptable. Screen goes completely black when viewed through polarized glasses. (Only went 70% black with old Samsung Galaxy S3). This makes it dificult to use with polarized sunglasses outside.* Marshmallow phone-dial interface is fast, but is missing features. It is dificult to search for a contact and view or edit it. It always defaults to calling them when you find and select a contact.* Photos with the main rear camera are marginally lower quality than those with Samsung Galaxy S3. Even though exposure and dynamic range is better, the pixels themselves are smudgier than those on the Galaxy S3.* Speaker-phone volume could also be louder but regular phone volume is very good.",

I've been partial to HTC because it was familiar to me, but I wanted to try something new with a bit more durability. I've been impressed with this phone thus far. The screen is crisp and bright and I don't mind the Amazon ads - in swipe and it's gone. The speaker isn't bad...but it's not great either. Certainly not a deal breaker. If you're budget minded and want a good phone at a decent price, this is the one to try. Just slipped the sim card I and I was good to go. FYI..it takes a micro SIM, not the nano so get an adapter if you're on nano now. Also, if you're with Cricket, don't go the store where they will insist you need a brand new sim for $10. I just used the adapter, put my current sim in and powered up. No problem, and the website updates your phone info automatically.",

After hours on the phone with Blu, I have done a factory reset...hard reset...and then it quit working altogether. I really liked it. My daughter has the same phone and it is working great. Maybe I got a lemon but it is very frustrating.Update 2/26/17:After my very frustrating experience at the 3 month mark I have figured out the original problem. Another user had posted that they needed to update the Android web view when their Amazon apps quit working. So I updated the Android web view app and everything started working again. I am still frustrated that Blu customer service did not know that and had me do a factory reset. When that did not work they offered to exchange the phone. Glad that another user figured out the problem so I did not have to exchange it.I give it 3 stars mainly because of customer service. They did not know how to fix the problem.The phone itself when it works is good.What I like:1. Phone never over heats. My Samsung Galaxy S5 got extremely hot after watching just a few minutes of video. I mean too hot to touch! I have never had that problem with this phone. I watch videos on my phone a lot and this one only gets a little warm but never hot.2. It is slim and light weight3. I am an Amazon junky so I love the preloaded apps4. I travel a lot and I love the dual SIM. I have my at&t; SIM and my international SIM in one phone. VERY convenient.5. Video is clear6. Phone is fast...faster than the S57. Never a problem with calls...calls are always clearWhat I do NOT like1. External speaker is awful. I can barely hear it even at full volume2. Camera....really bad....does not take clear pics....always a little grainy3. Customer service.....reps should have more knowledge than me as to how to fix issues.",

The audio (via handset or speakerphone) is terrible- Nobody can hear me, I have to use earphones to enjoy music. The USB connection to a PC (win 10 & 7) doesn't work. The ads, which I thought would be the worst feature, are actually no problem at all. Hardly mind them, (even though the ads are usually for Dog Food, and I don't have any pets). Battery life is limited, and my internal storage was full very quickly. For the price it was a great replacement phone, but certainly not one I'll keep long.",

So far it's not what I expected. The ads are a bit disconcerting and the Prime apps use a lot of memory. I have not figured out how to remove them to make room for other apps that I need for wi-fi based communication (Skype, GroupMe, Facebook etc). So I am abroad and I don't have enough memory on the phone to download additional apps and I did not see an \"Uninstall\" option for the pre-installed apps. So address this I bought a 64 Gig memory card so far that's causing a different set of issues. Finally, I have had problems connecting to free wi-fi at two airports so far. My travel companions have a Samsung and iPhone and they were able to connect their phones to open wi-fi without a problem. I'm not sure if all unlocked phones are like this or what, but I was surprised that I had these issues considering the great reviews of BLU phones.I advise that people who are new to unlocked phones consider buying one with more memory and without the pre-loaded apps. Also, load the apps you want to use prior to traveling abroad.",

After all, it is marketed to the lower-income crowd, mainly in Central & South America, as well as China,etc.  However, this thing is fantastic - beyond my expectations!!! The screen size is larger than expected, and the construction of the phone body is solid.  It has dual micro SIM chip slots and Android 6 (Marshmallow) pre-installed. I also installed a 64GB micro SD Card.  I have bought and discarded Android phones that cost 5 times this price that didn't work  1/10th as well as this unit.  My one and only complaint is that that there is no interchangeable battery. That being said, this phone does not come loaded with bloat-ware; it's fast; and the Android 6 makes customization easy.  To be honest, this phone competes very well with my Galaxy S5 and with my iPhone 6S Plus.After a week of use, I still rate this phone with 5 Stars. The battery life is excellent for an Android phone; but doesn't compare to the iPhone 6S battery life!!!!  I simply cannot believe how great this phone is for such a low a price.  It's my next test to see if this phone \"upgrades\" the Android 6 (Marshmallow) that was pre-installed.",

Absolutely a POS and not recommended ... this was a short lived product that ultimately is not worth the headaches!!!Update:Much to my dismay, a half day's worth of random test pictures (none significant) on my \"new SD card\" are BLANK ... turns out that although the card was preformatted, recognized by the device and previously stored media (from another device) was also recognized and accessible, new material does not get properly recorded and stored.  The device does not prompt you to format a new card when inserted, and as such you would assume it's OK but it's NOT ... all new cards you insert and plan to use in the device for \"new material\" must be formatted \"in the device\" prior to use otherwise you'll have the same issue down the road.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:Switching chargers seems to do away with the power issue.  I rechecked all physical configurations to ensure cards were properly plugged and the protective case was not causing any of the buttons to stay pressed.  I also checked the power connection and switched to a second power supply (also from BLU - second phone).  Seems to operate normally last 48 hrs but will keep watching it - other than that still very happy with the phone which continues to perform exceptionally well overall.  Loaded tons of apps on the SD card (64gb) and watched a movie which ran perfectly while I was traveling on a bus.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:So a few days with the phone and after updating various settings a few really great things happened and one definitely not so great thing.  Reading some of the other reviews I tweaked battery life/wifi/screen brightness which SIGNIFICANTLY improved battery life with moderate use and also I tweaked picture quality and sound quality both equally improved.  Puzzling however is the fact that battery life (% indicator) periodically drops to 93% or less even when plugged in, charging and not being used.  Even more concerning is that the battery has never reached 100% charge in the past few days.  I am now downgrading my initial review and will monitor for any other power fluctuations which is now reminiscent of other past Android devices that randomly discharged without explanation and had to be rebooted and recharged ... if anyone else is experiencing this issue (even after applying the recent OS update) please advise.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Truly UNBELIEVABLE quality and performance at this price point for Prime members $49 and $59 - too bad it's limited to only 1 piece each, I would have bought 5 for everyone in the household.  I am just amazed and hope this will last and function like it does day 1 - I highly recommend it and can't say enough good things about it ... it's a quick connect, high-speed, HD screen, awesome camera front and back, full capability, with expansion options, laptop-like smart-phone in the palm of your hand - just amazing!",

    "text": "Received this phone yesterday. I am moving from the Amazon Fire phone which, while it was a sales flop, is actually a well engineered piece of hardware that operated well and had great battery life. 3 members of my family use Fire phones and all are satisfied. The only struggle with the Fire phone was no access to google play. We have 1 kindle reader and 4 Fire 8.9 HDX tablets so we are invested and generally very happy with Amazon products.First impression of BLU wasn't good as I pulled off the cheap plastic back to discover that it uses a micro size sim card. Next, getting to my Amazon Apps wasn't intuitive at all. Open the Amazon app on the main screen but then have to find this Amazon Underground to drop down another menu to finally see My Apps. I'm an engineer - I don't struggle with technology.3 stars because the screen looks nice and over all it seems to operate well.For $99 ($49 because I'm special) how much phone should one expect? In the past, Amazon has provided good products with ads and difficulty reaching google play as the penalty. Now we seem to get cheap hardware with ads but access to google play. It will be a deal breaker for my willingness to continue to use Amazon (sponsored) hardware if this phone ends up having any operational issues.*******update I returned this phone on Sept. 2. Horrible, Glitchy. My 14 year old doesn't have a phone and is constantly asking to use mine. This phone was so bad, it frustrated her to the point where she finally left me alone!!! 1 star.There were some questions asked. Why did I complain about a micro SIM? Because most modern phones have a nano SIM and I had to go find the little piece to stick the nano in to make it a micro.Can it be used as an mp3 player. Yes with headphones. External speakers were horrible.Found a BRAND NEW fire phone on craigslist for $100. Good price-solid phone-good speakersTo be clear- this is perfectly priced for a $49 phone. I was spoiled to Amazon's previous offerings on kindle fire tablets and phones and expected more. My mistake. You get what you pay for.",

    "text": "As a preface, I'm writing this review for the $59.99 BLU R1 HD (16GB Internal / 2GB RAM) to mostly point out the 1 aspect of phones that everyone ignores. Thank you for reading.--------------------------------------------------------------------I like this R1. The screen's colors appear to be true and the backlight is bright enough to use outdoors on most days when it's not 100% sunshine. What covers the LCD is a nice panel of Gorilla Glass 3 with curved edges that make the phone feel somewhat like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (in other words: premium). When taking photos using the \"Professional\" mode, you can turn out some really nice pictures at a decently high resolution. The fluidity of day to day tasks is simply incredible; rarely does it ever stutter when I do ANYTHING\u2026However, until recently, I hadn\u2019t gotten around to putting in my 32GB SD card that stores all my Lossless music files. So I did that, and after plugging in some inexpensive headphones of mine, I noticed the output was pretty distorted in comparison to how the song is actually supposed to sound. I tested a hypothesis by outputting the headphone jack to a set of speakers instead of some cheap cans (slang for headphones) and concluded the inside of this phone was doing something VERY wrong to my audio\u2026 The treble was muted, the bass was muddy, and the spatial cues were almost entirely lost \u2013 to some post processing in the settings named \u201cBesAudEnh.\u201d Here\u2019s how to get rid of it:------> Go to settings, Sound & Notification, Sound enhancement, and turn off the two enhancements that might be set on when you receive your phone. And while you\u2019re at it, turn off \u201cBesSuround\u201d; I frankly don\u2019t trust it either. <------I'm no Audiophile who thinks 192kHz sound files are \"more open\" than 44.1kHz sound files, but I\u2019m still telling you that whatever you do, do not enable these enhancements if you plan to listen to any music through the headphone jack, or even if you wish to watch YouTube videos through the cheapo rear speaker.In effort to [somewhat] test the reproduction quality of the DAC after disabling these enhancements, I decided I would run some \u201ctests.\u201d So I connected my phone to my stereo receiver and did some playback comparisons between it and iTunes playback through an external DAC I have for my PC. The components are as follows:R1 HD Phone:1. Playback application: Rocket Player (Premium Unlocked)2. File type:  Exact same file to that in the PC (mostly Apple Lossless)3. Equalization: Off/disabled4. DAC: Internally soldered to motherboard5. Connection to amplification stage:\u00a0KabelDirekt 3.5mm Male to RCA MaleWindows PC:1. Playback application: iTunes 12.4.1.62. File type:  Exact same file to that in the phone (mostly Apple Lossless)3. Equalization: Off/disabled4. DAC:\u00a0Audioengine D15. Connection to amplification stage:\u00a0KabelDirekt RCA Male to RCA MaleAmplification Stage:1. Amplifier:\u00a0Onkyo TX-80202. Speaker wire:\u00a0Mediabridge 14AWG\u00a0w/\u00a0Mediabridge Banana Plugs3. Speakers:\u00a0Cerwin-Vega XLS-6I matched the output volumes of both sources as closely as I could. Digitally, the phone\u2019s playback volume is identical to that of the PC:  both outputting true 16 bit depth (in some cases 24 bit depth for a few songs). However, I opted to set the analog volume (that is, the volume of the tiny amp inside of the R1) to maximum to ensure that if there was distortion or interference induced by the circuitry of the motherboard, it\u2019d be more pronounced by the time I heard it from my speakers. However, as a reference, the external DAC I used for my PC avoids the interference from the computer by simply being an external component. However, the Audioengine D1 also doubles as a headphone amp, so it has its own analog amplification before it outputs through RCA in the back of the device.  As for the loudness matching purposes I mentioned earlier, this is where I had the room to adjust the volume to match the output to that of the R1 HD phone; I had to turn the volume dial of the D1 down about 1/4th to 1/5th of the way to match the phone\u2019s maximum volume output, but that fourth or fifth actually was quite a bit of perceived volume (to be expected, given one amp is inside a cellphone and the other is designed for high-resistance headphones that need more juice).Now that I\u2019d calibrated the setup, I was able to just connect the phone and my Audioengine D1 to my ONKYO amp with the appropriate cables identified above. With the volume knob on my amplifier and the source selector knob, I could amplify both signals coming in and compare them at any volume level, simultaneously. I threw my massive 24bit 192kHz files (Lossless), my large 16bit 44.1kHz files (Lossless), and a few of my inferior 128kbps & 192kbps MP3s/AACs (16bit 44.1kHz too, but Lossy file types) at both DACs. I tried to strategically play albums that would reproduce different sounds. Albums like \u201cAbbey Road\u201d by the Beatles have a lot of Dynamic Range that gives an album more of a live feel. But an album like Yellowcard\u2019s \u201cOcean Avenue\u201d have considerably less Dynamic Range, where the music sounds the same loudness throughout the entirety of the song. I also tried to hit albums that have a lot of stereo separation (not that I owned any \u2018mono\u2019 music, but some stereo songs these days sure are getting close). So playback of the Eagles\u2019 greatest hits and Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cEvery Picture Tells a Story\u201d album was absolutely necessary. I don\u2019t own much music from that you\u2019d hear on the Pop/Rap radio stations, but I did include Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989,\u201d Grouplove\u2019s \u201cNever Trust A Happy Song,\u201d Marina and the Diamonds\u2019 \u201cFroot,\u201d and also Norah Jones\u2019 \u201cCome Away With Me.\u201d All of these are great albums that I\u2019d already listened to many times in full; I was trying to play stuff that I thought was both complicated & something that I was 100% familiar with.What I noticed was that the signals coming from the R1 HD and the Audioengine D1 sounded \u2013 for all intents and purposes \u2013 identical. You read that right: identical. Pretty much, the DAC included in the R1 (and its accompanying dinky little amp) aurally matched that of my D1 DAC/Headphone amp. The only discernable difference occurred when maximizing the volume knob on my ONKYO amp (which I did at the end of a song when the music was fading, of course). There was never ANY hissing (circuitry interference) from the Audioengine D1 but an offensive amount of hissing and crackling coming from the BLU R1 HD, on the same songs! So while I couldn\u2019t hear ANYTHING at normal playback volumes and probably nothing even at louder levels, the circuitry interference is definitely there on this phone. It\u2019s harder to distinguish when listening over speakers, but if you plan to listen through headphones only, the problem is likely to be more prominent for you. Otherwise, just about everything I threw at the R1 reproduced identically to that of my \u201caudiophile\u201d DAC, with the exception of some minor interference and much weaker amplification (but that\u2019s to be expected). If you were to blindly switch my current setup to play off the phone instead of my computer, I might not notice.--------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:I don\u2019t have the equipment to determine the technical specifications of the phone\u2019s DAC (in order to compare them to my D1), but I\u2019m currently emailing BLU to inquire the exact DAC they used in this device. While ultimately it comes down to how a piece of equipment sounds to your ears, starting off with the technical specs would\u2019ve been nice, considering that I was playing a lot of high-quality music files that you won\u2019t find on iTunes or Google Play Music. I\u2019d be interested to know if this phone is even rated to support files above the sample rate of 44.1kHz and bit depth of 16 bits! Obviously the other 90% of this phone is pretty satisfactory, but I thought for sure they would have to cut corners on the audio. Just a couple years ago, everyone was! PC motherboard makers and phone makers alike. But it seems BLU gave us some pretty decent gear in this device. Before discovering that audio enhancement setting \u201cBesAudEnh\u201d was enabled, I was really disappointed with the R1. But after disabling it and doing my best to compare the R1 HD to my PC setup, I found this phone\u2019s DAC to be just fine for the audio enthusiast. Thanks BLU. :)I included a diagram to show how I tested the phone vs my D1 DAC.",

Perhaps for the more seasoned Android phone user this model may seem pretty basic however the BLU R1 HD exceeds all my expectations for this price! The phone is easy to setup, easy to install apps, easy to customize and for all those out there that are worried about obtrusive advertisements on the lock screen, honestly I haven't even noticed. When you have any notifications waiting the ad listed is tiny so it's not blocking your notifications. The design and feel gives the impression of a more expensive phone. If I could complain about anything I would say the speaker is a little under powered but that may be also that I'm hard of hearing most the time. Seriously though, the phone is really nice for such a low price. I would recommend it to anyone not wanting to spend $700.00 plus on an IPhone and would be happy with Android.",

I use my phone for business - commonly juggling between communication apps and gps - and, while not the most robust, this little guy took everything I could throw at it. I also enjoy playing games and this could keep up with quite a few of them.And then the honeymoon was over. The battery life started dwindling and I found that I had to constantly keep an external battery around or have a power supply close by. Still I persevered. Then the random reboots starting happening. And I put up with those. And today, the screen quit responding. I rebooted, but nothing fixed it.So time to buy a new phone. I didn't even want to put in for the warranty repair since I know those are complete crap and they always find something wrong and a reason they don't have to replace it.And Amazon won't let me buy another at the promotional price.

I have not purchased a phone per say from Amazon before, but when I purchase a New phone I I expect to get what I would get if I purchased this same item from elsewhere.I also am interested in why my phone box was previously opened prior to my opening it, especially since the item is factory unlocked, hence the no need to open and unlock the device elsewhere. I am a bit disappointed in this.",

    "text": "my experience with this phone so far is great! The major keys to making this phone run as smooth as possible is, well pretty much common sense. When you first get the phone, instantly disable all the Amazon apps, along with other useless apps, and make sure to also \"force stop\" these apps so they don't run in the background and take up memory. After that I HIGHLY recommend you getting a 64gb sd card( preferably one of the Sandisk and 'Samsung pro' ones) and go into your settings and make that sd card your main internal memory (settings>storage&usb;>press on your sd card>press on the 3 dots at the top right hand corner>format as internal) once you do that, any app you download will be stored in your sd card rather than your internal storage. The final thing you wanna do is download \"clean master\" (or any other memory cleaning app) and pretty much just clear your ram through that app when you feel like it's performing slowly and you should be good!Final thoughts: it's a great phone for a cheap price, display may not be the best, but you can still stream videos at 720p 60fps with On a big screen! Camera is ight, but personally I don't use this phone to take pictures, I use it at school to record my prof. Lessons when I walk into class tired or drunk. It's a great media streaming, and even a great gaming companion. And best of all, it's android!! I have an iPhone, so with this phone I'm getting the best of both worlds! Once again, I highly recommend getting this phone!!",

Not that it is a huge deal, but I can only view about 2/3 of the emojis people include with their texts. For the others, I just get a box with an X in it. I could get over these things though, especially for the price. However, I have started having REAL issues now, after using the phone for only about five months. When the phone shuts down (like if the battery runs out) and then I restart, I get this weird DOS-like screen with some options that don't let me select anything. The only way I have found to get rid of it is to shut it down and restart again. But the real dealbreaker is that now the battery doesn't want to charge. I plug in the charger and it looks like it is charging, but then it stops charging for no reason. I have to go back and plug it in again multiple times to charge all the way. It is as if it isn't making a good connection. So, the moral of the story is, you get what you pay for. I was hoping this phone would last me a year, but it looks like five months is about the limit.",

BUT, and this is a biggie, Bluetooth is not connecting to any speaker. Pairing is okay, but doesn't play any media or transfers data. I saw there are others with the same issue (after I bought the phone unfortunately) but no solution offered seemingly.  I am quite happy with the phone overall and most probably give BLU a second chance and will replace this unit, but that issue needs to be solved.Update: Contacted customer service and her is the reply: 'Keep in mind that our devices utilize standard Bluetooth Profiles, and some manufacturers require more extensive or specific Bluetooth profiles that may not be compatible with your device.'My list of devices includes items like the Echo, a Pioneer Car radio (the cheap one), a Hyundai stock car radio, jambox, a speaker that cost something like 20 bucks, a similar speaker in similar price range (Sylvania) and NONE of them works. Might understand the reply for anything in the top price range, but surely a $20 bucks speaker is using 'standard' Bluetooth too.Some other little things that I started noticing, even the Aux connection didn't work all the times, and the responsiveness of the touchscreen around the edges is not 100%.Unfortunately I will have to send the phone back, I like the idea of a cheap smart phone, but it just isn't doing what I need it for. However I am still thinking it is a good phone for the price and fulfills most of your needs.",

I'm going to compare the Blu R1 against my previous phone, a Motorola G from last year.First of all, this phone is slow. It takes forever to open any app, especially the Facebook app. Once you open an app it takes a few seconds to actually do anything with that app. I hate the placement of the charging port. I hate that the power button is below the volume rocker instead of above it.The battery life is abysmal. My old phone (2015 Moto G) would easily last me all day most of the time. At least once a week I spend the day listening to podcasts, but I have to stop at around 2 so this phone doesn't go dead before I get home at around 4. Even when I don't listen to podcasts all day I have to charge the phone at around 5. Now, I do take the phone off the charger at about 5:30 in the morning, but my previous phone handled this task much better.Last, but not least, the phone is quiet. The ringtone and notifications are quiet, sounds from games and videos are quiet, EVERYTHING is way too quiet.There are some things about this phone that I do like. It was cheap and... That's actually about it. The ads aren't as bad as I thought they would be and they're easy to get rid of.I didn't get this phone in hopes of getting an iPhone killer. I knew I was getting a cheap phone, but I thought I was going to get a better phone than I got.

    "text": "Don't let the Amazon pre-loaded software and ads scare you off, this is a fantastic phone for the price.  I got this to replace an 18-month old but very broken Samsung phone that was easily 4 times the price of this one.  If you're into specs you can read other reviews to get the details.  I'd like to highlight some impressions from it's first hour out of the box.First impression: the build quality is impressive.  Case build is tight, screen is glossy and bright.  Like all phones this leads to a slippery feel but there's going to be a case around it as soon as it arrives.Second impression: the phone booted to Android 6.0 which is very smooth and slick.  Google Restore actually worked, which was a huge plus to recover contacts and apps from the broken phone.  The 64GB microSD goes in and the system asks whether to use it as a media store (external) or internal store (for apps).  Having run out of space on other phones I chose the latter, and within minutes had moved most Play Store apps over to it in a snap.  It would be great to have Android do this automatically but I'm not complaining.Third impression (really part of the first impression): performance is smooth and very snappy screen to screen.  The screen is really nice.  A review I read recently made me wonder if the resolution was too low and the screen would look grainy.  Not at all.  This thing looks top notch.Fourth impression: Is the Amazon adware a distraction?  Not so far!  The lock screen shows a small ad and there's a wizard on one of the home screens that displays another ad.  The wizard can be moved around or even removed.  Only the lock screen ad seems to be required.  I watched a youtube where it was disabled altogether using a 3rd party launcher.  I don't plan to go that far.  These are not intrusive.  Definitely worth the savings to me.What about video and sound?  Quick tests of the Amazon Video and Youtube apps were clear and crisp.  Some won't like the little speaker button on the back of the phone but this is isn't likely to be your only media consumption device.Any nitpicks?  Well, having always used Samsung I've been used to the Home button.  This uses softkeys.  That's no big deal.  And I don't exactly love the silver \"BLU\" logo in the bottom bezel.  Ok, that's it so far.Conclusions: This is so impressive out of the box I might get another one to replace my slightly aging Galaxy S4. I wish the Kindle had taken this approach--the best of Amazon but with Google Services.  Oh, and so long Touchwiz and carrier bloatware.  The BLU R1 HD seems to me the perfect blend in a small and unbelievably inexpensive package.  I can't see how I'll shell out $600 for a flagship phone again.",

    "text": "At first I was very happy with the phone. For the price the specs are very good. I came from a cheap windows phone and this phone blew it away as far as usability and specs. After 2 months of use the phone erratically started restarting on its own (no big deal, annoying, not a deal breaker though), but after a couple of days of that is started freezing and showing green lines. It would then restart and restart and so forth and so on. Fortunately Amazon was able to get me a new phone even though it was out of the return window. I got the new phone and everything was ok. Until a 5 months later, it started to do it again. This time amazon wouldn't get me a new one (understandably), so I had to call Blu for warranty work. Luckily they said it was probably under warranty and they would look at it. Well, I had to pay for shipping there (maybe I just feel it is bad policy because of how good amazon's is). It has been 1-1/2 weeks since it was delivered to BLU and customer service said it will be at least another week if not 2 weeks for them to ship it back.The phone was never dropped and was taken care of very well inside a case and screen protector. I can see maybe one dud, but two? COME ON! This is obviously a blu problem and I will not buy another of their phone ever again. Hope you don't make the same mistake I did",

It's pretty snappy and responsive with stock apps. I'm sure downloaded apps would slow it down through. Since it's just for my mom to make calls, it's more than adequate.Cons:It runs VERY HOT at the top where the camera is. Hot enough to be very uncomfortable to hold. This is very concerning. All I did was turn it on to set it up, and to download Facebook & Messenger, neither of which app I even opened yet. I am worried this thing will catch on fire. I shut it off to cool down and charge.

If your a practical user like me, calls, news feeds, youtube, and a ton of apps all work flawlessly. If there was one thing I would like it would be a bigger screen, 5.5\" would make this a stellar phone. But if you're looking for snappy response, great connectivity, excellent display and quality construction in an entry phone look no further this one delivers the goods. Just for reference I had a One Plus One as my primary phone, beautiful phone stellar display, the Blu Rd has a better phone and was able to give me 4g just about everywhere, even my Iphone 5s, a very good phone, left something to be desired. There is also a psychological element here that's making me gush over this thing.... did I mention it's only $59? I can buy a few of these and keep them as back ups if I lose or break it. All in all it's a great phone, my girlfriend has the larger model now for almost 2 years and its been flawless, and she is hard on phones, this one has held up as good as her Iphones and Samsung devices for a fraction of the price. I've read a few negative reviews on the camera, it is more than adequate for average users so don't let that stop you, I have used mine to post a lot of stuff on EBay and the pictures look great! I use USmobile as a carrier, you can buy your minutes and data as you need them, my plan usually cost me under $20 a month! That's it, my cell phone anxiety is gone and I'm a happy camper! Good luck!",

    "text": "Great Phone!! I bought this for my daughter after hearing for the 30th time that my old iPhone 5 I had her on with T-Mobile was too small. I'm not about to buy a 15 year old a new iPhone for $700 so I shopped around for unlocked Android alternatives. Happened on a review of this phone on YouTube. We've had it now for almost a week and she loves it. It's big, does everything she needs it do do: play games, take pictures, social networking. We transferred all of her music from her iTunes account to Google Play with Music Manager (recommend doing it from a PC). I also changed the UI to Zen UI from the Play store. It makes a prettier setup and really works well with the phone. Tweaked a few settings to make the apps open/shut smoother. All-in-all, I can't say much negative. The only reason extra star missing is that after charging it to 100% at about 11 pm and taking it off the charger for the night (leaving it hooked into WiFi and not on cell data and shutting off all app windows) the charge goes from 100% to 88% by 8 am. I'm not really sure what's sucking the charge but it's been awhile since I had an Android so I guess it just has to be tweaked to reduce that charge drain. Thus, I deducted one star for that. I will update if any good or bad comes up but overall, $60 for a newer, bigger phone to make the kid happy is quite a bargain.",

Once beyond that now ready to install Micro card an boost memory. Play all music. View alol kids an dogs pics on new phone. Not. Does not  identify MC. So call think Mr. Robotic at BLU.com . Grab a smoke before do this . Maybe 3 . They make you register before they just will stop babbling on an on,Wha u no register. Over an over an over,an refuse anything else. So ok register with language barrier take like 15 mins. Get this have to have them email you factory reset instructions to get phone to regonize it has a micro sd card in it now. Yeah wtf. So hang up with someone in  Philipnes or somewhere. An  reset an play an wow sd card works now.About hour of bs to get it functioning. Now here is one if got no patience. This phone is not for you. If like me,I download music on internet . Headphones in gym,got have. So time too connect you new phone to computer. Wow snap. Here now Hammer tyme. Stop,  Windows 10 does not recognize R1hd phone,or any phone from BLU. So back on phone with BLU. Yo nu regista for 10 mins until finally get them to understand just did earlier. After some more time of listening to Mr Robotic person on phone. They finally admit Windows does not regonize their phones. Gee thanks for headache. So luckily when purchased my new laptop from Best Buy,paid for protection. So guys at Geek Squad in Winchester. Big thanks cause they got my computer to find the phone, But issue. Had do a operating system update. Go to BLU.com direct an play with drivers on their site till worked.Took total time of 2 days. to accomplish what should happen out box. Phone is also full of Amazon apps. Nice thing delete. Not like Samsung. Once I removed them. All 5 or more. Spent 2 days of aggravation with wonderful Androids at BLU.com.  My phone works great now.

    "text": "Wow! This is a great deal.  The lock screen ads are not bad, in fact I like them.  I can't believe I got this phone for $59.  I added a 64 GB micro SD card which I think was about $30 at Costco and the phone was able to integrate it with the 16 GB.  It may not be the fastest phone in the world or the highest build quality in the world, but it is good enough.  I still can't get over that the full price of this phone is less than the deductible to replace an iPhone with Apple Care.  Battery life is good.  It has two sim card slots and the micro SD slot.  I did have to get an adapter to move my nano sim card over.  The T-mobile store gave me a free adapter and helped me do it.  I don't think I'll be getting anymore top of the line phones anymore because this is 80-90% as good and 10% (or less) of the price.Update:It turns out that when you add a Micro SD card and allow Android to integrate it with system memory, it is not perfect.  Some apps are not allowed for some reason to be installed on the SD side, even though it is supposed to be as if it is one block of storage.  It is easily possible to fill the 16 GB accidentally because of this and still have plenty of storage space remaining.  Because of this, definitely don't go with the 8 GB phone.  This 16 GB should be the minimum considered.  Still, I am getting by fine with it.Battery life is not great.  It seems like when I take it off of the charger, it drops from 100% to around 88% in no time.  Then, it seems to level off.  Still, I doubt if I would get more than 5 hours, even with light use.  I am used to charging throughout the day, so it is not a big problem for me.I know I said I would never get a fancy phone again, but I decided to try out an iPhone 7 Plus.  After 12 days, I returned it to Apple and went right back to the Blu phone.  I was overwhelmingly happy to be back.  The iPhone is fast and luxurious.  It has a near-professional quality camera and an all day battery life.  I got bored with it and I missed my simple, smaller, lighter Blue phone that did everything I needed it to do.  Also, the iPhone 7 Plus screen scratched easily.  For a phone that costs nearly $1000 that I treated like a newborn baby, I was not happy to see obvious screen scratches.  The Blu which has no case and gets tossed around everywhere, sometimes with keys, and usually sits in my back pocket, has no screen scratches.  Or maybe the brilliant fancy glass of the iPhone shows off its scratches more clearly.  After getting my refund from Apple, I walked down the mall to my cell phone carrier store and got a free sim card adapter.  I popped it into the Blu and everything was great again.",

Buyer beware you get what you pay for...It is a great phone HOWEVER it lacks a compass and gyroscope sensor so apps like GOOGLE SKY MAP will not work properly. But for as cheap as it is it is not too much of a problem. But this is the perfect marriage of Android and Amazon. It has both GOOGLE PLAY and AMAZON apps.It has ads but there are ways to remove this the ads are not intrusive and only on the lockscreen and you can swipe them away. However, I think it may void warranty if you do that,since you have to do something similar to a root. The AUDIO is good, However the touchscreen lacks some sensitivity not bad tho. And sometimes it may hang up on you easy fix is to turn off screen. It has dual sim unlocked. Holds up to 64GB MicroSD. And allows you to hotspot.  This is a great cheap phone so you are not out a lot if you break it. There is an HDR feature for the back camera that allows you to take a much more colorful and detailed photo. 8MP is 4:3 for some reason and 6MP for 16:9. Both Cameras have a flash and autofocus which is new to me for front cameras because I never seen that on any phone before. There is a 5/4MP camera (4:3/16:9 respectively) on the front and the VIDEO CAMERA has A Normal/High/Fine or 480/720/1080p@30FPS.",

It allows me to use my phone sparingly and not worry about carrying a larger tablet around.The size is about right. I did get a simple clear gel case for it and that helps the grip. Screensize is pretty spot on without getting into the super phablet size. Good OS. The ads are actually not as terrible as you think. 99% they're just there while once in a while you see one or two that grab your attention in good ways.Overall I really can't say anything bad about it. I really cannot perhaps aside from the speaker could use a little kick in there.One Year Later:I've fried the battery. Even with light usage for movies, books, etc and not using phone calls, I'm lucky to get a full day of battery life. Now it is relegated to an alarm clock and work android of sorts.

Bought a $10 Hong Kong sim card before I left, also from Amazon, and everything worked fine. I didn't make a dent in the data on the card. (Also, I did the same for Japan, and everything worked smoothly.) The phone PLUS the sim card cost less than Verizon $10/day international plan would have cost. One note -- the Hong Kong sim card didn't work until I put it into the first sim card slot, rather than the second.

    "text": "So I just gotta say, if you are upgrading your Cricket phone from the Nokia Lumia 630 series to this BLU R1 HD 16GB you won't be disappointed. I've had my Lumia 630 since 2013. It has been a disappointment to say the least, mostly because it's a Windows phone and I can't access Google apps with it.  1st, the BLU R1 HD feels great. It doesn't feel cheap at all. It looks and feels very much like a high end phone. Especially with the curved Gorilla Glass screen. The screen resolution is clear and bright. The color is vibrant. Every bit as good as my HD TV. Video playback is sharp and detailed especially when streaming from Amazon or Netflix. The external speaker's volume leaves a little to be desired, but I haven't found a phone yet that has decent sound from the external speaker. That said my headphones sound great with the R1 HD.  Great apps from Amazon and the Google play store that I couldn't get with my Windows phone.  I haven't\u200b experienced any glitches with the R1 HD. Unlike my Windows phone that glitched at least every day.If you are looking for an inexpensive, high quality, does everything you need smartphone the BLU R1 HD is the one.",

    "text": "( I am a college student. )--  Since the speaker is on the back of the phone, all audio or speaker phone calls are practically inaudible. I resort to using headphones because the speaker on this phone is useless. (I bought this phone after losing my galaxy s4 which is relatively old but still way better than the R1 HD)-- The device lags at many points in my usage and I am not even a hard user. Few background apps running thats about it, and the phone will just freeze or lag for over 10 seconds every time i tried to switch apps or close the apps. Its very frusttrating especially when i need directions in a pinch because I will miss an exit or a turn and ruin my commute. (This happened multiple times.)-- The screen looks good, however, the hardware on this phone is complete garbage. The screen touch response is horrible. The reason why I am writing this review is because my screen stopped working two days ago. I can view the lock screen and can change the volume using the buttons but other than that I cant do anything. Everytime I try to swipe and unlock the phone, nothing happens. The screen doesn't respond. i tried taking out the SIM and doing it, nothing. I tried other things too, and still nothing. I am without a phone right now, and since I passed the 30 day return policy I cannot return it. The BLU customer service told me to factory reset it but its not a software problem its a hardware issue. I did it anyway, and nothing changed just as I expected. As i am writing this review I am trying to fix it but it looks like I am going to have to buy a new phone.Summary: this phone is less than decent and will fail on you sooner or later. I would not reccomend this phone to my friends.If you are looking for a budget smartphone, dont go with this phone. spend the extra $100 or so and get yourself something that wont give you extra unnecessary stress in your life.",

For purchasers who have had great experience with this device, lucky you. A $60 smartphone is inexpensive indeed but is it really that cheap considering the volume of Amazon Ads that pump through at will? Anyways, to my experience, RD1 indeed looks smart and compact enough for one hand use but the processor speed is very slow. It takes up to 90 seconds to reactivate the device from standby, the touchscreen response is eratic and slow, sound and camera qualities poor and the battery life simply abysmal. I have to carry a battery charger pack as life support for the RD1 lest it dies even from standby point. Also, the screen stays blank for incoming calls and has to be manually activated to see the display. Mind you RD1 is the second BLU smartphone I have had five months and both have disappointed immensely. I`d accept my money back if Amazon will refund it",

To clarify, I wasn't expecting much for this price, and it outperformed my expectations. The lower rating is due to the fact that this product is not built to last. Another friend of mine also bought this phone and was experiencing similar issues after about 3 months. Definitely recommended if you need a phone to get you by until you can afford something better. I've switched to the Moto G5 plus and am having a much better experience, but I also payed 3 times as much. Prime ads didn't bother me at all. This was my introduction to android from apple, and it convinced me enough to stick with it. Never paying $800 for a phone again.",

Camera isnt the best if you used to top notch stuff, but it'll do okay for most people. The Amazon ads are a total none issue, one swipe and they are gone when you first unlock your phone.

    "text": "Most of the things I can say about the phone it's been already said so I am just going to point out a couple of things that in my view you should consider when buying the phone:1) PROTECTIVE COVER: Do yourself a favor and get the protective cover. I bought the $7 BLU cover+screen protector. The cover is very nice and as for the screen protector, I had no issues at all. You just have to be patient and follow the instructions and it will stay nice with no bubbles and I installed two of them.2) PORTS: USB port is at the bottom and the headphone port is at the top of the phone. For most situations this is not a problem but it might be awkward to use the phone when charging while using the headphones. Plus, if you use the phone with VR glasses, most of them have inlets for power and headphone cables only on one side so it might be a problem.3) SENSORS: No gyroscope. Again, for normal day-to-day use you should be fine. But, no gyroscope means pretty much no VR games or 360 video. This is a bummer for me since I already own an iPhone 6 which I use with VR glasses but I wanted to have more variety of games/apps plus I wanted to be able to use a game controller. Even tough this particular detail I could not find on AMAZON's page it was ultimately my fault for not making sure. Now, you will still be able to watch 3d SBS material but just not get the whole 3D VR experience with his phone.4) SIM CARDS: The phone uses microSIM cards. You will need to get and adapter if you have a nanoSIM card. BUT, I just inserted a nanoSIM card without an adapter, it stayed in place and the phone recognized it with no problem. It's been there for at least a week and it still works. Not the most elegant setting but will work until you get the adapter.5) SD CARD: The specs say that it accept up to 64G cards. I've read lots of reviews saying the phone gives a message indicating the card is too slow but eventually being reformat with no problem and some people even say it gets formatting forever with no luck. I even read at the Q&A; section of some people installing a 128G card with no problem but I have not confirm that. If someone can update on this it will be appreciated.6) VIDEO OUT: This phone has no HDMI video out port. BUT, you have several options that will let you use the phone for streaming video. It works with Google Chromecast so you can stream Netflix and all the compatible apps. If you want to stream other kind of video/app you can use apps like LocalCast that will let you stream pretty much everything you have on the phone including screen cast and most importantly it will also stream via Apple's AirPlay, Roku and DNLA enabled devices. If you do a Google search it will even let you stream Kodi.So, this phone is a no brainer for people with regular phone usage habits and for more tech savvy people it makes a good second/spare phone.",

Then the power cable started to go faulty, it only charges intermittently now and I've tried plenty of different cables.Also sporadically it gets clock issues, the internal clock will just \"pause\" until a reboot- alarms won't go off, I've been late to work, etc. This started about 6 weeks in.Finally now, 2 months after owning the phone, it cannot receive any text messages. If it does receive a text message, it is over 12 hours late. Some texts come in days later, some don't come at all (or I just haven't gotten them yet, maybe it sometimes takes weeks?)I am very upset by the 30 day return policy on Amazon. All issues started around 45 days and just keep getting worse. If I had bought a phone through AT&T;, they would have covered this under warranty. This is honestly unacceptable and makes me question Amazon's integrity. Sure, it's a cheap phone. I'd expect a cheap phone to run applications a little bit slow. I'd still expect the phone/clock functions to actually operate.

I won't go into detail about the phone's other assets like the camera and all that because, for a budget phone, they're fine. I only want to give my 2 cents on one aspect of the phone. I've used the phone for a full month to get a better feel for its ins and outs and there's one seemingly small problem that's turned out to be huge that's crushed my opinion of this phone: the back speaker is terrible.At max volume, audio is too quiet to hear even when alone in a room. When you actually can hear it, it comes out garbled and scratchy. I thought I could overlook this by putting headphones on, but, honestly, I didn't want to need headphones when watching something in bed/at my desk. By extension this meant I couldn't casually listen to music without holding the phone up to my face. It also meant I couldn't use this phone as my alarm clock so I needed to keep my old phone out and charged at all times. Outside the house, I needed to buy a Bluetooth connector for my car (Luckily the\u00a0GOgroove FlexSMART X2 \u00a0is an excellent connector for even people without audio issues at 40$) if I needed to hear directions when going somewhere new. For music/videos you also have the option of dropping ~20$ on a Bluetooth speaker, but by buying too many things to compensate for a missing function you leave yourself wondering \"why didn't I just buy a better phone?\"If you have Amazon Prime and are just looking for a cheap phone with 2GB of RAM that can play Pokemon Go or Hearthstone and are fine with missing a basic function, you can have this phone for 50$. At 100$ (for those who aren't fortunate enough to have Amazon Prime), I'd probably avoid this phone and save up a little longer to go with a high/midrange phone like the ones listed on r/PickAnAndroidForMe.Hopefully BLU comes back to this phone and gives it a facelift, but they probably won't as to stay at the 50$ price point.",

    "text": "PROS:BatteryScreenSoftware (Fairly stock 6.0 + frequent updates)DesignPerformanceCONSSpeakersCamera QualityLet me just say right off the bat that this phone is an incredible deal at the $60 16gb + 2gb RAM pricepoint. Of course, that price is only accessible if you are a paying prime member (free trial of prime won't get you the discount). Upgrading to double the memory and ram for only 10 dollars is a no-brainer.I will start with the lock-screen ads because that is what makes this phone so cheap and my polarize different people. It all comes down to if you're the type of person who gets annoyed or feels fundamentally violated by having something you don't control on your lockscreen. I am not one of those people but I understand some feel that way. For me, I wake the screen and swipe into my pattern lock in around a quarter of a second. I don't even have time to see what the ad is. The lockscreen ads are completely unobtrusive to how I use my phone. The phone also comes with a dozen or so amazon affiliated apps. You can uninstall some, but for others you can't. However, if you go into app settings you can disable the vast majority of the remaining apps which uninstalls all updates to that app reducing the file size and removing it from the app drawer. This makes it so that you never see the apps and they take up very little space on your phone. Overall, these two things are a very small price to pay for having an Amazon-subsidized phone. They do not bug me in the slightest and if anything, I'm proud of the little gimic that makes my phone stand out from the rest. A note on the lockscreen ads: they are based off of your amazon searches so most of the time they are fairly relevant or at least targeted to your gender/age demographic.Now that that's out of the way, I'll try and address the phone in a more conventional phone review. I'd like to say that I am a college student who uses their phone mainly to text, call, and use every social media as well as consume youtube videos. I follow all the major tech channels on youtube and am fully aware that the BLU R1 is no flagship killer and makes some huge sacrifices to cut costs.Screen - pretty good. Like I said, you have to know what you're getting into with this phone. Coming from a 1080p AMOLED phone (that died prompting the quick purchase of this phone), the colors and crispness on this 720p IPS (non-AMOLED) screen were noticeably inferior. The colors were less vibrant and it overall had a colder color tone. Having less resolution, images were not as crispy as my previous phone. All these things were to be expected. I was actually impressed because it looked much better than what I was expecting and much better than another 720p phone I had used in the past. Text still looks very sharp and unless you have it side by side with another phone, there is nothing to complain about with the display. It gets bright enough to be seen in direct sunlight (a little furrowing helps) and doesn't detract from the experience in any way.Performance - Also pretty good. This really exceeded my expectations; the BLU R1 HD outperformed my old phone (Moto X 2014) in every way. Opening and closing aps, switching between different social media apps and messages, all felt fluid with just a little lag from time to time. The Mediatek processor performs very well and is able to run games like NOVA and other basic games no problem.Design - I really like the way the phone looks and feels in the hand. It does not feel or look cheap in any way. I prefer the soft touch plastic over metal because it is much more grippy. It doesn't pick up too many fingerprints either. There is a small camera bump on what is otherwise a completely flat rectangular slab. There is real anodized aluminum along the edge that feels just as high-end as the aluminum on my moto x if not better. The fact that the phone doesn't have a rounded back or extremely thin sides makes the phone feel very robust. The screen edges curve slightly over the edges making swiping in from the edge feel very tactile and pleasant. There is a substantial chin and forehead on the device but it anything it makes it a little easier to reach the bottom corners of the phone. They are also symmetrical so it looks alright too. The side bezels are very narrow which combined with the curved edges make the phone look very attractive.Camera - This is where most cheap phones take a huge hit and I expected. The camera is not good, don't expect it to be. For me, that's okay since most of the things I use a camera for is snapchat or instagram. If you care about your instagram photos, you could easily enhance your pictures using snapseed or a similar app to get it up to snuff. A huge pro with this camera, however, is its zero-lag shutter. The camera app that comes preinstalled takes photos instantly when you press the button. This feature is incredibly useful and not something I expected in the cheapest smartphone you could buy. So the camera isn't the greatest but for me actually being able to capture the moment is more important than a high quality picture a split second too late. (For the first time ever, I've been able to take pictures of my dog which previously moved too quickly for my old phone).Battery - great. Actually lasts me all day from an 8am gps - tracked run to all through classes and lab ending at 10pm. I use it between all my classes, while eating, etc. checking social media, listening to spotify, using wifi and bluetooth and between 50% and 100% screen brightness depending on where I am. The battery life is so great and is helped by the fact that the processor is not super powerful and the screen resolution is only 720p. The phone won't charge any quicker with a 1.0A or 2.1A charger so just know that.Final thoughts. I rarely write reviews, especially reviews this long. I felt like I had an obligation to write this however because this product truly deserves it. What finally put it over the top for me was BLU's support for this device. I've been using this phone for around a month now and I've received 3 over the air updates. The first one (which I got the second I unboxed my phone) allowed the Tmobile LTE #12 band to be used by the phone. I use T-mobile and sure enough it instantly worked with LTE everywhere I go here in Southern California. A more recent update fixed my only gripe with the phone so far. Previously, the bluetooth connectivity would take minutes to connect and sometimes not connect at all. This was a huge inconvenience for me since I prefer using my bluetooth headphones to listen to spotify. The most recent update completely fixed this and now my devices pair and connect immediately. Besides that, I would absolutely recommend using nova launcher as it is a simple and beautiful launcher that allows you to run completely stock (and pixel-like) android on your phone.I originally bought this phone because it was the cheapest unlocked smartphone money could buy and wanted something to hold me over until I had enough money to buy a \"proper\" smartphone (a oneplus 3t hopefully). But considering that this phone is one-seventh the price of that phone and honestly does everything I need it to do, I'm actually going to use it for quite a while. Even if it breaks, for the price, it's justified to just buy another.To conclude this long and drawn out review, this phone is I believe one of the best deals on Amazon period. If you go into it knowing the tradeoffs of buying a sixty dollar phone, you will actually be blown away by what this phone has to offer.",

    "text": "I think a revolution may be underway.  TV's, PC's, Microwaves, nearly all electronics that quickly come to mind have been introduced to the public at an incredible price point, then eventually as the market adjusts become more and more affordable.  This has not been the case with cell phones.  Case in point:  I foolishly bought an LG V-10 through the A,T&T Next Plan for a mere $27/month.  Over the 24 month payment period I will have paid over $600 for the phone.  See, the problem is the phone was crap from about day 14 into ownership, and quit working completely 13 month into the payment plan.  I am still paying for that colossal mistake.  Enough about my stupid purchasing decisions and falling for the sucker come on.So, I have been using the BLU R1 HD for about 90 days now.  I paid 60 bones for it and figured that if I got two months out of it, I win.  Guess what:  It does every single thing my $650 mistake did, and does most things EVEN BETTER.It is rugged:  I bought an $8 case from Amazon when I ordered it, and it is not intrusive and does a fine job protecting the phone, but it has taken some pretty good licks and the integrity of the phone remains as good as the day I took it from the box.It has a great display:  Apps look great and function well, with no hassle what so ever.Set up was a breeze: I put in a sim card from ATT and strangely, the phone started working IMMEDIATELY.  All of my apps transferred from Google seamlessly and I put it to work at once...no problems, NONE...and the best thing...it still functions like the day I got it.The camera is only 8 mp, but works great for what I want out of it...keyword here being WORKS...could not say the same about the prissy camera on the $650 mistake.  Video is not a problem...in fact the BLU seems to handle and process videos better than the mistake.There are a few compromises which may have to be dealt with for not making a $650 mistake.  The processor may be a few nano-seconds slower than the mistake, making some tasks appear slightly clunky...but it's not bad, and when you consider that you haven't paid 10 times the price, it is at least a 10 times better value.Bottom Line:  This phone is an incredible value, and performs at least as well as units costing 10 times the money, and in some areas even surpasses the mistake.  I will never do something so idiotic again...the revolution is on.",

    "text": "The phone was nice, real nice for the $$.  The only problem is that it does not work with Verizon, Sprint, Boost, U.S.Cellular, TracPhone and who knows what other carriers = CDMA networks.  I spent over 3 hours going back and forth with my cellphone carrier and BLU trying to get my service switched over to the new phone. No luck.  Each time I called BLU they said something different.  I am surprised Amazon is associated with this phone.  When I called Amazon the immediately told me to contact BLU.  If you connect to one of the towers of the above listed carriers you will not get any service.  You can only get the phone to work with AT&T; or T-Moble networks = GSM networks.  Very disappointed!  I was so looking forward to this phone with Prime benefits.",

I opted to pay more for the Ad free version and I feel I got a great value. If you wanted to save money and get the with ad version that is even better, a crazy good value at $49!  Compared to my old phone the only thing I miss is the old flip phone had better battery life (i.e. a week or more on stand by) but this get's you through the day. Get used to charging daily.

I left it charging overnight as I have been these past few days. The following morning, it would not turn on. I tried doing the hard reset method to no avail. The red led does show up when it's charging, so I don't know what's going on. Luckily, Amazon has a pretty nice return/replacement policy.I'll give this phone another try.

They will make you pay for shipping it to them even if they admit the phone is correctly at under-warranty fault.2. I paid the postage,  and then for the first time, the phone just came back as-is, no repair and broken microphone. And then they wasted almost an hour again making me try all random things like reboots, resets (mind it, phone already had nothing), which have nothing to do with this hardware issue.3. After some fight with customer service supervisor, they agreed to send me a replacement phone if I send this back again on partial cost to me.4. Voila, I receive a new phone after 1 month and this one is a 8 GB instead of 16 GB.5. They are again not admitting their mistake and in fact are just contradicting themselves by some time claiming that my phone was 8 GB at first place (I of course have an Amazon receipt) and some time asking proof that phone I received is 8 GB. How can you do both at the same time?I still don't have a replacement for a very valid in-warranty issue.OTHER ISSUES: Battery will start draining in 5-6 hours after a few months of purchase.SUGGESTION TO CUSTOMER: Stay AwaySUGGESTION TO AMAZON: Why associate yourself with such a cheap company?",

The blue tooth on this one didn't work much better.  If you use a lot of Bluetooth pairing I would not recommend this phone.  I was able to get the phone to work with the car by disabling the phone as a portable player which was OK with me.  It still works as a hands free phone.

The buyer gets the same kind of Amazon ad screens or \"special offers\" found on Kindles with Special Offers but this added feature brings the cost to $60. This is a full featured smartphone running one of the latest versions of Android. The phone feels solidly built by BLU. It lacks the NFC feature but for the price,  it is a small compromise. The camera is very good and takes good photos in regular light. Low light photos could be better. For the price,  I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for an affordable Android phone who does not want to spend the $300+ other phones fetch.",

    "text": "I would like to write a 4-star review of the 16GB version, and a 2-star review of the 8GB version. Unfortunately, Amazon aggregates the reviews as if it were a single product, which I think is silly.16GB - Four stars. Works great. Excellent bargain. Ads not terribly intrusive. There is one con: The internal storage is NOT 16GB as advertised, but 12. See the picture. 11.1 GB => 12 billion bytes. The internal storage is 12-gig, no doubt about it. It's still enough for me, and as you can see I've added a 32GB SD card (again, what my PC measures as 29.8GB = 32 billion bytes, which is what SD and other flash-memory-based card manufacturers market as 32GB) works for me. Unfortunately, because of this math error (trying to be generous), I am somewhat soured on the product.8GB - one-to-two stars. Android 6.0 takes up a full 4GB of space. When I looked at storage in settings, the device told me the following:* 7.92 GB total (or something like that).* 4 GB for the OS (understandable, though so much more of a space hog than 3.whatever, which was on my last phone),* 1.7GB used by apps,* 300MB for miscellaneous, which adds up to about 6GB.Yet it said that remaining space was only a few hundred MB, and was giving me a low-space warning. It seemed that around 1.7 GB was being used by some phantom space hog. Weird.It appears that that may be true with the 16 ... er, 12GB version, but there's enough space and I'm using the SD slot for storage anyway, so it's fine.And regardless, the 8GB does not work properly. Even with an added SD card, due to the way that Marshmallow works, in order for it to be useful, you have to format it as a drive extension, which takes away the portability of the card. Furthermore, when I did so, I found that the SD slot is not entirely secure (physically, I mean), and had to be adjusted somewhat a couple of times to even register. This is not OK, as an SD card as drive extension fails to register as being properly connected, that means bits and pieces of apps are inaccessible, which means that the device will be significantly crippled.At any rate, the takeaway is this:(1) Go for the 16GB version;(2) Be aware that you are actually getting 12GB of internal storage (or less), not 16.(3) It's still a pretty awesome deal.",

The SIM card holder on his was loose, so at times we had to reinsert the SIM card, but it worked well otherwise. The reason for the low review is because of the strength of the Gorilla Glass. In the name of caution we purchased a protective case for the phone as well. Less than 6 months after the purchase my son dropped the phone (in the case) on his bedroom floor which is carpeted and the screen shattered. This is insane for Gorilla Glass, especially with a case on it as well.",

    "text": "UPDATE 11/15/2016: Well, all of my fears of cheap Android devices has been validated today. The New York Times has a report [...] indicating all of the BLU R1 HDs (among other BLU phones) have a bit of software, Adups, that is sending private information back to Chinese servers! BLU has updated the software (which was not a bug, by the way, but rather specifically written to spy on Chinese citizens and accidentally included in BLU's software) and is ensuring us that all of the data had been deleted from the Chinese servers. However, the damage has been done for me. I have switched back to my Microsoft Lumia 640 full-time and will be wiping my BLU R1 HD soon. I'm glad BLU jumped on the issue, but I cannot fathom why they would let this happen to American citizens in the first place! This will be the last BLU product I will ever purchase!BACKGROUND: I dropped cell phone contracts a few years ago, so I've never owned a true flagship phone. I started with a cheap-o Android (Gingerbread) phone and hated it. From there, I switched to Windows Phone and was much happier. The Lumia 520, then Lumia 640 were solid budget phones that ran the OS really well. Windows Phone does a very good job of running on low-end devices and it has most of the apps I need from day-to-day. However, the apps are rarely updated in their store so sometimes you're stuck with a buggy version for months at a time. I wanted to try Android again to see if they have improved, but was afraid a budget phone would suck on that platform. I pre-ordered this phone immediately because I figured $60 wasn't much of an investment if I hated it. I still had my Lumia 640 to fall back on if the BLU R1 HD didn't pan out.IMPRESSIONS: This phone is SO much better than I thought it would be! The build quality is fantastic when compared to the plastic-y phones I'm used to. It feels very solid, the soft-touch back is not slippery or a fingerprint magnet, and the screen is very sharp. Android Marshmallow runs very smooth with the 2GB version. I never have to worry about meticulously closing all of my apps when I'm done with them. I just pull up what I want, and it loads immediately. On my Lumia 640, there was always a small \"Loading...\" screen that popped up while Windows Phone was shuffling memory around. Sometimes the app would even crash and I'd have to start all over again. I have yet to see an app crash on the BLU R1 HD. I did find a game or two that was a bit jittery, but I don't play many games on my phones anyway. As long as I can run a few time-wasters (like \"Punch Quest\", \"Kingdom Rush\", and \"Dots\"), and I'm good to go.VERDICT: All of the apps I need are here, they are updated almost daily, the system is rock-solid, and the phone is a joy to use. I did install a 32GB microSD card and set it up for extended storage. That gives me plenty of breathing room to play with. Also, I highly recommend that you install \"The Weather Channel\" app! This app will put up a persistent notification (in your tray and lock screen) that shrinks Amazon's ads down to a simple notification. This is much less intrusive and I basically never notice the lock screen ads anymore. Overall, I am very happy with this impulse purchase!OS COMPARISON: After using Android Marshmallow for a couple of weeks, I am missing the live tiles and clean status bar of Windows 10 Mobile. Android crams all notifications in the status bar with the app's icon; and nothing on the home screen (just static icons staring back at you). Windows Phone puts a single notification icon in the status bar, counters on the app tiles, and flips the tiles to display portions of the content. You can put widgets on Android, but I can't see enough content unless I resize them to take up most of the screen. So, you have to swipe between home screens to get similar functionality that is baked into Windows 10 Mobile's tiles. Also with Windows 10's Anniversary Update, the apps are loading almost as fast as they do on Android now! None of this is the fault of BLU; just thought I'd put this comparison out there for Windows Phone fans that are curious :)",

A bad way to get customers, if you ask me, because it makes me want to not click on the ads. I don't like forced ads.That said... the phone is $50 and it's a nice phone otherwise.I'm not into spending a bunch of money on a phone. I mean, come on. It's a phone. I don't play games on it, I don't go on the internet on it, I don't do anything but call or text.I wanted a basic smartphone for a decent price and this works.It does have some bells and whistles, but I don't use them.Now, about the ads. This is what I do to make them not be so annoying:I go to SETTINGS, then I go to DISPLAY, I use a picture I took of my dog and set that as WALLPAPERThen I turned off Cell DataI also restricted background displayDoing those 3 things every time I turn on the phone (I turn it off every night), makes the ads not take up the entire screen, and they are only little banners, so easy to ignore.I looked up other ways to get rid of ads, but it's kind of complicated and if you turn the phone off like I do every night, then you have to do the entire process every single time, and that just seems like a lot to me.So, doing the above mentioned, I can minimize the annoyance factor of the ads and the phone is fine.That said, if I want to use Google maps, I do have to turn on Cell Data again.So, there you go.***UPDATE***Phone is working fine. Only thing is, battery gets low pretty fast. I barely used it today and it's already down to 60%. Not bad, but thought worth mentioning. If I don't turn it off overnight, it'll get drained down to 40%. Has done that before, so just saying...",

But that being said, this phone is pretty much the most awful piece of technology on earth.It has good battery life, which is nice, but it also turns off on its own pretty much as regularly as I want to use Facebook and then realize that I can't. On top of that, every time it turns off another one of my Apps disappears from the home screen, no error report, just gone.None of the apps really work.  If you open it, there's probably a 85% chance that it will crash and you'll loose everything,  Hell, I tried to write this review on the damn phone and It crashed 4 times and I WAS STILL ANGRY ENOUGH TO USE MY COMPUTER TO WRITE THIS.  Mind you this was using the Amazon App which is suppose to be well integrated with this phone!It makes calls and texts just fine.You get what you pay for with this phone!",

Be very careful with it especially if you want to use both slots. Also, the charge doesn't last long. When I'm at work I have to charge my phone when I just charged it last night.

    "text": "For the price(59 dollars with the ads) I cannot be happier. The build quality is really nice and it feels like a much more expensive phone than what it is. I bought this phone as I have to send my Nexus 6P back as it has phone call quality issues so I just needed something for the 2-3 weeks of waiting to have it returned. The thing is I am unsure once I get my 6P back if I will keep it or just sell it on craigslist. That is how much I like this phone. Below are my pro's and con's but I really have zero con's for the phone at this price.Pro's-Build quality looks great and does not feel plastic like at all. Additionally, I really enjoy that it is not slippery like my 6P.  I also like how they designed the screen glass in appearance.- The screen quality is really good for the price. Honestly, unless you have a very hi end 4k type of screen you will not be able to notice much of a difference unless you are really looking hard.- Phone performance is snappy. I have not really noticed any lag at all yet I do not play video games or things like that. I just pull up webpages and apps like google maps and this performs basically the same as my 6P.- Amazon Ads- I was really worried about the ads and if it would be obtrusive while trying to use or be a drain on resources. I can tell you it is not. It is so unnoticeable and you literally just swipe it away like any other type of notification on your locked screen.- Phone call quality is great. I have had a couple of test calls and everything tested clear as could be.- I have not had a chance yet to test the bluetooth yet if it is anything but solid I will come back and update.Cons- Camera- I struggle even to list this on a 59 dollar phone yet  if a camera is incredibly important to you then you may not ever be happy with this phone. Now, if you can only afford a 59 dollar phone then it is what it is. But out of everything that is where this phone lacks the most.- Speakers- Honestly, they are not terrible but not loud. Also, I always just use headsets so to me it really holds no value.- Battery- No quick charge battery, yet again its a 59 dollar phone. If you expect a 59 dollar phone to have that you are kind of a moron yet wanted to point it out as that could be a deal breaker for some people(It almost is with me).Overall I love this phone. I owned a Asus Zenphone 2 that I purchased around 15 months ago that I paid 200 dollars for. This phone absolutely destroys it in every way. From look, the build, to the screen brightness and feel. It's a 59 dollar phone folks but you will not be embarrassed to be seen carrying it.",

Don't even bother  calling after 30 days up Amazon will not help (even tho there ads all over the phone smh) or take this crap back. i was using this as my  second phone  emergency or when my iphone out of battery so you know i barely use it. Here the problem phone freeze here and there but this time it didn't come back on. I restarted the phone it didn't come back on yes it was fully charged but just in case i did put on charger yes it was the factory charger it came with. Red light charging was on but wasn't charging or turning on. i went online did all the research hard reset reboot hold power button valume bla bla bla ect didnt work. then it hit me back in the days flip phone if  take battery out and put back in itll work.  Well guess what cant do that on Blu R1 HD because it glue on. Eh whatever i took lot iphone apart before so i took Blu phone apart which was easy but taking battery out was little hard with out bending it. OK so I unplug the battery n plug back in put everything back together  walla it works. Idk why they didn't make the phone with removable (easy fix ) which most people are having same problem i read. I wasn't going waist my time talking n sending phone for warranty paying for shipping for a $60 phone with BLU and waiting 30-60 day get it fix.... But it would be nice they send me new battery because mines all bent up . Really was easy fix .......Blu support if you see this and send me new battery ill update my review and give it 5 stars  I really did love this phone for price and performance.",

Well, the phone has been out for months now and they still have not delivered what they promised  Right on their web page as in the image below, it says:  4G LTE band 12(700 MHz) will be available via OTA (Over-the-air) update shortly after launch.Blu - where is this important update?  You can't promise it and then not deliver.  It is the only reason that I bought this phone model.  I saved a copy of the webpage where you said you were going to do it here: [...]I will increase my rating on this phone to 5 stars if they will release this overdue update.",

    "text": "The good:The screen looks amazing, and the UI is responsive.  With as few intelligent settings choices battery life isn't as bad as some of the reviews had me believe.  *Also check out some of the battery saving apps out there - they seem to help.  I also like Android's ability to warn and limit cell data usage (to keep from fees and/or slowdowns).  Price ... I bought this with prime advertising for a $50 discount.  The ads are on the lock screen as well as an add widget on one of your screens (you can set it to the back screen).  So is it worth the $50 discount? - I think so.  I paid $60 for a decent smartphone.  Ads are only slightly annoying, not terribly so.The bad:I like the phone but having come from an iphone 4S the user interface and ease of use is lacking.  No ability to selectively block calls/messages.  No visual voicemail.  Organizing apps on the screen isn't as nicely done as in iOS.  Even something as simple as handling contacts, looking at recent calls, copying & pasting between apps isn't done as well as in iOS.  If you're coming from an iPhone or other iOS device you'll probably get annoyed here and there with just about EVERYTHING along the way.  Battery life is as other reviewers have stated, merely ok to good. Battery is non replaceable.  When the phone dies, or the screen cracks, it won't be worth fixing.Final thoughts:It feels like a quality phone with an amazing screen.  Two sim card slots are nice. It's unlocked (no contract)! I get 4G speeds on AT&T;'S network.  WIFI and cell network speeds both look good.  SD card slot for extra storage is really nice. It's fast, it's inexpensive, ads aren't too bad.  User interface is ok for android, but doesn't compare well to iPhone's iOS.  AT&T; employee I had change out the SIM card was impressed at both the quality and the price.  Uses the same SIM card as an iPhone 4S.",

The front camera is a little better.After downloading all my apps I decided to check out how the speaker worked. I tried it with Pandora and the volume is decent, though not very clear. Then I used it to talk to my friend on the speaker phone. I was not impressed with the quality of the call, it was both much quieter than usual and harder to hear them.Though, for a phone that I got for $49.99 I was happy.Only after about a week of use it started to act up. It started to get slower and it would take a while to load when using apps.The Bluetooth is shoddy and disconnects from my devices a couple of times before it can stay connected.It also seems like it is fighting with apps like Pandora, by not letting my songs load and just letting them buffer continuously.I have to restart my phone every day now in order to get it to stop acting up.I'm thinking about getting a different phone and returning this one before it gets worse.I would have given this phone one star if it hadn't been so inexpensive.",

    "text": "I needed a new phone because my $600 Sony Xperia S had been dropped and the screen cracked. I had my Sony since it was first released (March 2012)  until January 4th 2017 when I received my BLU R1 HD. I don't buy phones often and when I do I usually buy one that is top of the line so I don't have to upgrade for a while. I bought this one until I decide which high end phone to purchase. This phone is quite nice, bigger than my old ones but smaller than the tablets some call phones. I do notice a lag or lack of recognition when I type a text but reopening the app usually resolves that. The ads aren't as much of a nuisance as I thought they'd be and I barely notice them. I'm sure you could just root the phone and get rid of the ads altogether but that's up to the end user. I charged mine for a full 24hrs before use and the battery seems to last awhile. I don't game or watch tv/movies on my phone so expect less up time if you do. I mainly access the internet and e-mails on Wi-Fi with no router or modem issues like some have reported. If the phone is the problem then you would think it would occur in other locations with Wi-Fi. I think the persons issue is probably the router since they state that changing the router settings will cause everything to work normally or something. User error I suppose.For $59.99 this phone is a great buy and worked with my 4 year old sim card from my old Sony Xperia S. I wasn't a fan of the launcher Blu uses so I downloaded the SLT Ubuntu Style and Smart Launcher 3 both are free. I love how organized everything is now. The rear LED is really bright in comparison to my old Sony and makes for better flash when taking a picture. Photo quality is a tad bit lower than my old Sony which had a 12MP camera, Video capture video at 1080p @ 30 fps which is equal to the BLU R1. The front facing camera has 4 different choices when you click on the box with an A in it which comes in handy, if you take selfies. For those who don't know BLU phones are capable of using 2 sim cards simultaneously. So no need to switch one out for fear of the other not working. It comes in handy if you do a lot of traveling. I'll update if anything changes.Loving how solid it feels too.Specs from the BLU WebsiteTECHNOLOGYAndroid v6.0 Marshmallow2G: 850/900/1800/19003G: 850/1700/1900/21004G LTE: 2/4/7/1712 will be available OTA(Over-the-air)PROCESSORMediatek 6735 | 1.3GHz Quad Corewith Mali-T720MEMORYInternal 16GB/8GB I 2GB/1GB RAMMicroSD up to 64GBDISPLAY5.0\u201d Capactive Touch PanelHD 720X1280 - 294ppiBLU Infinite View (IPS Technology)CAMERA8MP Main 3265x2449 pixels5MP Front with LED FlashHD 1080p Video @30fpsBATTERY2500 mAhCONNECTIVITYBluetooth 4.0WiFi, HotspotMicro USB v2.0",

    "text": "I bought this phone back in July 2016 when Amazon had their Black Friday special.  I needed a replacement for my old T-mobile Android phone which worked horribly and internet was virtually impossible.  I has paid almost $100 for that phone so when I saw Amazon had a phone for half the price I was a bit skeptical.  Now I'm not a heavy phone user just need basic service and occasional internet.  My Blu phone came with Ads that I didn't mind since I buy from Amazon often.  Since the phone was unlocked I was able to use my old sim and I was ready to go.  The phone was slightly bigger than I'm use to but not so big like a tablet. The five inch screen is perfect.  It already has several apps downloaded most were Amazon.  When I first  tried to take some photos with it and the difference was amazing.  I was embarrassed taking photos with my old camera.  It has a 8MP rear camera and 5MP front facing if you are into selfies.  I showed the phone to friend who only buys the latest iphone and he was impressed.  He thought it was very high end phone and when I told him the price he couldn't believe it.  Now if you are worried about the ads you just scroll past them -no problem  One thing to note I have the 8GB model they also have a 16GB model with more internal storage.  I bought a micro-SD for extra memory.  This phone has exceeded my expectations and don't feel ashamed to pull out my phone anymore.  For the price that they are offering I don't think you could get a better deal.",

    "text": "I've had this phone one day and so far, I like it.  I have never had an iphone, so I can't compare.  I'm android all the way and prefer it.  What I like the most is that it feels like a solid, expensive phone and the fact that there is so little bloatware on it.  There's only the amazon stuff on it, and the essential google chrome etc.  So nice not to have a junked up screen full of crap I don't need or use.  The phone itself operates fast.  I was using the previous version of android OS, the marshmallow version is nice, fast and smooth.  If it makes any difference, I am not a phone junkie that downloads a ton of apps and spends all day on my phone.  I like to do a little email, definitely snapchat, facebook and the light surfing, so it's perfect for what I need.  For anyone wondering, it plays Pokemon Go, and it's very smooth.  The augmented reality doesn't seem to work (it didn't on my samsung, either), but you don't HAVE to have AR on to play and I have just as much fun with my kids on it.  As for the camera, it's better than what I had, from the snapchats I have sent and the few pics I have taken.  Oh and as for the ads.....I don't pay much attention to them. I am not opposed to shopping from them if it is something I like and targeted toward my needs, but they aren't big at all.  Don't let the thought of having ads scare you, it's not that big of a deal.  Seriously.  For what you are getting, it's a small thing to deal with.  I can see this being a great first phone for a kid.  I remember my kids asking me for an iphone years ago and I told them there was no way that I was buying that expensive of a phone for them.  They have since bought their own, which is fine.  But if you are looking for a solid phone for a teenager, this would be great.  And if they break it/drop it....it was only 60 dollars.  How great is that? Anyway, I hope to do an update to this review in a few weeks, but I already really like the phone.  Hope all this helps!Edited to add:  I have had this phone one week, I'm still satisfied.  The size is great for my hand and performance is good.  I do wish the battery life was a bit better, but it's still better than the phone I had before.  I just wish there were more case options, because I don't see anything I like out there yet.  Since I purchased this one, I purchased another one (without the ads) for my 20 yr old college student.  The screen was broken on her older Nexus 5, which she was going to fix for 139 dollars.  Why fix it when you can have a new one?  So for 109.00 we got the R1 HD for her and she seems pleased with it.",

But I must admit it is much more than I thought it would be and actually has some unique features that I had to download an app on other phones to use. It comes loaded with Android 6.0 and has the speed to run it very smoothly. The screen is plenty bright and colors appear to plenty vivid to me. The battery life has been quite good and seems to last as long or longer than Iphones, LGs and HTC phones in the house. The ads really aren't that intrusive or bothersome either and about the same as those that are many apps and don't affect the functionality.  I will start looking at other Blu products going forward since AT&T; no longer subsidizes phones and I haven't seen anything that is worth $400-$500 more than this one.",

    "text": "4 Month UpdateBasic: So its been four months since I purchased this phone. Its held up surprisingly well. I purchased this as a replacement for  my iphone 5s. I was on a budget & could not afford another iPhone .No major problems or issue's at 4 months. Ive dropped it a few times but its literally been in a case since I first purchased .This one -->\u00a0BLU R1 HD Case, POETIC Revolution Series [Premium Rugged][Shock Absorption & Dust Resistant][Heavy Duty] Complete Protection Hybrid Case w/ Built-In Screen Protector for BLU R1 HD (2016) Black\u00a0. Its kind of bulky but Im very hard on phones & its held up very good. Most head phone work with the case on but when it comes to AUX cords its a case by case kind of thing.So the camera is the weak point on the phone. Its not horrible but not on par with iPhone or top of the line android. You can take good pictures if you wait for the auto focus and put in some effort. Its not impossible to take good quality picture its just not as easy as my iphone. I found my self taking several pictures of the same thing to get a good picture. If picture/camera quality is a deal breaker, you might want to try another phone or model.For a $50 phone (what I paided) its highly satisfied.Service: I use a prepaid service: H20 wireless $30 a month for basic unlimited with a 4gb of 4g then it slows down. You can pay more up to $60 a month for more 4g if you want. I use WIFI at home & school so I dont need alot of data. I haven't experienced any drop calls. Sound and voice quality is good.Battery: I was very impressed with the battery. It seems to stay on 4% for hours with wifi & bt turned off. To be fair I could have just had a old battery in my Iphone. It also charges fairly quick as well.Cons: Compared to my  iPhone 5S, picture and video not as good as the iPhone. Ive always had issue's sending picture and video messages to non iphone and this is not an issue with the BLU R1. The back case of the BLU feels kind of cheap compared to the iphone. The speaker phone is definitely not loud enough, it could be an issue with my phone though.It would have given 5 stars but the camera and  the cheap feel of the back case keeps this phone from being a  budget 5 star.",

    "text": "It could easily best that this is best phone in its price range.  It's easily on par with the Moto G, and it's a fraction of the price.  You almost certainly know that already.  I'll get to the elephant in the room.  Ads on the lock screen.  It's just like the Kindle Fire only less obtrusive.  If you have notifications of any kind, even an alarm, then the ads are resized and you get a normal lock screen with a tiny add.  If you have a security screen then you'll have to swipe past the ad screen to get to the lock, but it's a small price to pay for such a great device.[Edit]: I feel I must also add what turns out to be my favorite feature, wireless hotspot.  Probably common knowledge among those using a BYOD plan, but not to me.  Cricket doesn't let you use their devices as hotspots, but I can use this with my plan and use it as a hotspot.  I live in a rural area and the internet is not very good at all.  I can get a 10mb connection for $71 from the local cable company.  Using this as a hotspot I get a an 8mb connection for just an extra $30 a month, and it's more reliable than the local cable company.  Lately I've been using it to play The Tomorrow Children and Destiny on it, so that makes me happy.",

    "text": "You seriously can't go wrong with this smartphone for 60 BUCKS. It has decent specs that would normally be in a 100-150 dollar phone. So alone, internally, this is such a steal. Get it now.Externally, this phone is attractive. I mean very attractive. It looks and feels like a flagship. In my opinion, it's on par with my OnePlus 2, and that phone is currently 350 dollars.Now i'll explain 3 amazing things and 3 cons about this phone. Keep in mind, it is a 60 dollar phone, so keep your expectations low.1. Snappy and Quick: (2GB Variant) In my one day of testing so far, it has not once slowed down, even with many apps open. That is impressive with only 2GB of RAM2. Dual SIM: I have put in 2 of my SIM cards in and I had no trouble using both. One for data and one for phone calls. On a 60 dollar phone, I have never seen a Dual SIM config before, so that surprised me.3. The Ads: Yes, I know, why is this in the awesome category? 2 reasons. 1. The AD's are relevant to what you have bought on Amazon in the past and from cookies, so it's not like you will be getting random ads. 2. The price of the phone is totally worth it, just swipe the AD away on the lockscreen. Think about it, is it really worth paying 50 dollars more for the no AD version?CONS:1. The Camera. One word... Subpar. Don't expect any low light photos with this at all, but in good light, its decent.2. This is just me, but I don't like how the Mirco USB port is on the left side on the bottom instead of the middle. That irks me alot.3. It doesn't have every sensor or feature that a flagship would have. But again, think of the price. the big 6-0.Conclusion: You have 60 dollars to spare? Don't even think about it. I made the split decsion to buy it and I have been loving it ever since. BLU & Amazon have struck a GREAT partnership and I hope in the future, more phones will be discounted heavily like this one. 100/100",

This was a good choice for me.  Got it for $50 with amazon lock screen ads plus a 32GB sd card, ting sim card and a case all for ~$100.The phone has plenty of power for my needs.

    "text": "So I bought this phone when I had to send my Samsung Note 4 back in to get fixed and it was going to take 3 or so weeks - work requires me having a phone so I decided to get the cheapest acceptable phone available. I must say, I am a dedicated Note owner, but I fell in love with this phone. It appears to be pure Google OS, it's smooth, ran all my apps as well as my Note did, and was very comfortable to hold without a case. The shape and size of the phone feels perfect in my hands, which I didn't know I missed since I've had the Notes for years! I almost sold my Note when I got it back and kept using my Blu phone. I love that it's unlocked, dual sim since I do travel overseas and I hate not having my own phone to use.The one and only reason I switched back to my Note was the camera - I didn't expect to like this phone so I didnt care about camera specs, but if I had gotten a blu phone with a better camera I am certain that'd be the end of my Note obsession - I can give up my stylus for a phone this smooth. In the time I used it, I downloaded about 3/4 of the apps I usually use and it handled the usage without issue. Battery life was fine and I was able to install the Samsung Health app so I could continue to use my watch! I will keep this phone so I have it for travel. I do love using it but low light photos are a struggle for it. If I could do it over again, I'd have bought one with a better camera, but this Blu seems to be very reliable and I do like it a lot.",

    "text": "If you are looking to buy a new phone, DON'T get this one!  I needed a new phone. The one I had was a Nexus 4, and the support for the operating system was not providing any more updates, which can be troublesome in more than one respect. I saw information on the Amazon Prime phones, and I opted for the least expensive of the two Blu R1 HD phones. I thought 1 GB of Ram & 8 GB of Internal Storage was good enough, I don't run music or TV/videos on the phone, and it houses an SD card up to 64 GB of external storage. If I was choosing again, I would go with the 2 GB of  Memory (Ram), & 16 GB of Internal Storage (ROM), which might be enough to not have this problem, but I don't know that for sure. I never had this problem with any other phone I have had.I really liked this phone for the first 2 weeks. The volume & on buttons are on the same side of the phone which is really nice, volume is good, camera is great, voice clarity is super, screen size is big, but works well for me, easy to get to the settings, really a great phone and at a super great price for Prime Members! And, as I said, I really liked this phone for the first 2 weeks...Then it wouldn't update apps because the memory was full, so it couldn't update the latest security. The first time this happened, I threw out all the apps I could, even ones I really like to use, threw out photos, and I was able to update the phone apps. (I am NOT an IT person, and it took me most of a day to do all of this.) It happened a second time, just a few weeks later, and I had only had the phone for a full month. This time there are no apps I can uninstall.The amount of memory that is taken up by google installed apps that I don't use or want is shameful, and when you try to uninstall them, all you can do is strip the updates, with a warning that it may cause other apps to not work right. I even have my 32 GB SD card set up as the default write disk, and the Device Storage settings read 7.80 GB used of 8 GB, while my SD card is showing 95.41 MB used of 29.82 GB. This is unacceptable. I can't imagine anyone who would be happy with this. At this rate, I will have to spend a lot of time freeing up memory every two weeks!  If I was choosing again, I would go with the 2 GB of  Memory (Ram), & 16 GB of Internal Storage (ROM). But you will still have lots of built in apps that you don't , or might not use & can't uninstall, such as Amazon Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Drive, Goodreads, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music, Prime Now, just to list a few. Most of these still use memory & battery  even if you don't use them. Yes, given enough memory/space to keep them updated, they might be really nice to have, but so is security.",

    "text": "I purchased two of these phones. One for I and the other for my wife. We received the phones two days after the release day.Phones we own; One 16 GB + 2GB RAM and the other 8GB + 1 GB of RAM.To get a hold of two with one Amazon Prime account, Amazon makes you order a slightly different phone because they have a limit of one of these great deals per customer. It was because of this that both phones were not 16 GB + 2 GB RAM. If given the option go with the more RAM as it is worth the extra money and makes the phone run a little smoother.The applications that I have been mainly running on this phone are Ibotta, Waze, Facebook and Netflix and each application runs flawlessly and quickly. I used Waze in a 3000-mile trip and not once did Waze or my phone let me down. The picture quality of this phone is simply incredible as it is bright and vibrant. It truly looks like a high definition image and one will not have any problem with this phone in broad daylight.The screen is made up of gorilla glass 3 and if one searches youtube and looks over the many videos one will see that the screen is almost scratchproof. What this means is no more screen protector with bubbles. I have been walking around with this phone in my pocket with keys and the screen is as perfect as ever. This doesn\u2019t mean it will not crack, it will, but if you are like me and don\u2019t drop your phones often you shouldn\u2019t have an issue with cracked screens.Many who might consider this phone may also be FREEDOMPOP users who are interested on how this phone works with that service.  So how does it work with FREEDOM POP? Flawlessly! Every month I get 200 minutes and 700 mbs of data absolutely free and this unlocked phone makes it possible to get this service.Over all I am a satisfied customer and would purchase these phones again. I honestly don\u2019t understand the one star reviewers as this is only a $50, $60 phone and not a $900 I phone.Below is a sample of the pictures I took with this phone.",

Got this as a spare phone to allow kids to play Pok\u00e9mon Go, which it does just beautifully, but I would be comfortable using it as my main phone. Screen is much larger than my iPhone 5. Having never used an Android phone, I found this one easy to configure and use. I would recommend it to anyone who utilizes Google and Amazon systems as the framework for the familiar systems and apps are already built in, ready to install...but not already downloaded (not taking up memory). Delete the large Amazon ads widget and you'll be left only with ads on the lock screen, which don't bother me at all.Edit: After using this longer, I would go with one of these over another iPhone. Sound quality is on the low end, and very faint, but most everything else is surprisingly great. It works well tethered to another cellphone's wifi hotspot, as long as you don't wander out of range, making it possible to play Pokemon Go without having an active SIM. My son, using the BLU R1 HD, actually got notification of Pokemon spawning even before MY phone did...and it was running on my phone's hotspot!Negatives: If you run too many programs at once, things slow down dramatically. If you've cleared the cache, shut everything else down, and you're not trying to download or install anything, the one game/app you're running should work just fine. It heats up pretty fast, and gets warm in hand.",

Unfortunately, it fell and the screen shattered, and you can't purchase two of the version with ads (at least not under the same account), so decided just to get the no ads version.Oddly, I am not as happy with this one as I was with the version with ads. I'm not sure if there have been updates that apply to both versions (meaning maybe the newer phones with ads have the same issues that I'm experiencing) or if the version without ads is just different beyond just not having ads.There are lots of weird annoyances. The phone switches randomly between sound profiles for no reason that I can tell. Sometimes I just don't get app notifications. Every so often the time is wrong, and I have to change the time zone and then change it back again to get the time to correct itself.One of the most annoying things about this version is that there is a Blu app that cannot be disabled that prompts me to register the phone. I hate registering things, so I ignored it a few times, but then it stopped allowing me to dismiss the notification. So I decided to just register the phone, but registering the phone requires me to sign up for an account with something called Warranteer! It is infuriating! Why do I have to make an account with some third party to register the phone just to get rid of the stupid notification?? And why don't I have the option to just disable the app?? I've tried a few third-party apps to try to disable it, but none of them work unless I root the phone, which I don't want to do. So now, whenever I get the notification, which is every other day or so, I have to go 'Force Stop' the app. It's really, REALLY, irritating and I definitely feel like this phone is not as good of a value as the one with ads.",

Takes only Micro SD cards and not the standard SIM card.  If you only have the standard SIM, getting a Micro SIM is a snap as they can be purchased almost anywhere.

    "text": "I bought the 16 GB for myself and the 8 GB for my mother. Overall everything runs decent. Facebook freezes at times compared to my last phone but this isn't a deal breaker. What is a deal breaker for me is the incompatibility of the Bluetooth. I use multiple Bluetooth devices to play media and phone audio. My 16 GB model will not connect to the phone audio on any of my Bluetooth devices, that my previous phone would. The 8 GB model oddly enough allowed phone audio for a small amount of time, but usually glitches and stops playing audio together for no reason. Which ultimately leads me to believe the Bluetooth components in this phone model are faulty. If this service is a necessity for you, look else where. If you will never need Bluetooth, this is a great deal.",

    "text": "I got this phone originally as a temporary phone until I could save up for something else later on. I was intrigued by the ability to add a SD card and expand the memory and the specs seemed solid for a good overall general experience. I work as a mobile QA Tester and so I am familiar with varying phones and work on them daily. However after getting this phone there are just so many issues that honestly make me regret this purchase even with the amazing price for this phone. Which is really sad because if it worked properly it would have become more of a permanent solution and made me a BLU convert.When I first got the phone everything worked great, the amazon ads built in were less intrusive than I thought they would be. The phone played all the games I needed for my kids, and was just as responsive and quick as my old phone, and I was on my way to thinking it was a amazing deal that I wouldn't regret. The only hangup I had with the phone out of the box was the bluetooth not connecting to all my devices. My old phone (nexus 5) would connect to anything but this phone seemed to be really picky about what it wanted to connect to. It seems to just pick and choose what it wants to connect to and if your unfortunate to have a device that it doesn't want to... well your out of luck. Even my sports wrist band will link to the phone but then blocks any transfer of information. Which makes it pointless to have for a device that monitors and transfers information back and forth. It will connect to my portable cheap china made bluetooth speaker, but then refuses to connect to my higher priced home theater. But I decided to just deal with the issue and move forward. (lets be honest for 50$ I was still impressed with the phone, and could deal with some devices not connecting)After setting up the phone and using it for about a week BLU had a required update. After this update and the following additional one after that, the real problems have come out. The phone no longer will connect to my PC allowing me to transfer files.... It worked just fine before allowing me to store music and files from work... then NOTHING! I find it odd because when I connect to the developer USB settings I can access the phone and see the phone connecting and when you use the picture only setting it connects. But the simple function of transferring files back and forth similar to a thumb drive simply has stopped working. I don't know if this function was blocked with the update or that it simply broke but its one of the first things I noticed. Secondly The Wi-Fi function now has seriously degraded. My home and work wireless function just fine and all my other devices haven't had issues with speed or connection, but after the updates my phone simply cant seem to hold a wi-fi connection. It drops it all the time and doesn't switch to my LTE. So even when at home or at work if I try to do something and the phone stops connecting my apps then lock or get stuck loading and I have to close them and turn off the wi-fi, and then try again. Finally and the biggest problem with this phone.... the internal clock stops.... AS IN IT LITERALLY GETS STUCK ON A CERTAIN TIME! I have literally had to start using my old phone as an alarm clock because the time on the main screen will freeze and lock. The phone itself functions and when I send and receive texts and the time stamp is accurate but the main time shown on the phone is incorrect. This has made me late for work more times than I care to admit because the clock app (including other apps I tried) reads from the internal clock. So when the phone decides to lock up at 6am..... well my alarm doesn't go off at 6:30. When this happens it just sits until I have to reboot the phone or it randomly decides to correct itself.This started off as being an amazing phone that literally had me thinking I found a permanent solution and that I didn't need to look further to something else later on. But after the BLU updates this phone honestly now is a complete waste of a device. I cant rely on it and thus it will probably become something I just let my kids mess around with. I was really ready to jump on the BLU band wagon (my brother owns one of your XL phones and swears by them) But if one of your phones cant even keep the time correct... its just not something I can recommend.Additional notes for anyone at BLU wanting to reply:- I did a factory reset after the updates and the issues continued- Although I have the ability and knowledge to ROOT the phone no modifications were done to it or the OS it was all stock- SD card was tested and all apps having issued are stored in internal memory (not a corrupted external memory issue)",

I have to hold it up to my ear when using the speaker phone function and trying to listen to something while watching a video is a nightmare.  What you do hear is nothing but high pitch noise that is almost unable to make out.  Other than that, it's a GREAT bargain.  Can anyone give me a comparison against the new Alcatel A30?  Heard that one has a great ext. speaker.I really enjoy this phone.  Gorilla glass (super smooth to the touch), beautiful screen (for a phone anywhere near this price range), no lag, very responsive, great call quality.  BLU really killed it with this one.  Probably the BEST budget phone option.  I wish there was a way to add WIFI calling as an option because the signal with T-Mobile in the building where I work is very weak.  Not the phones fault as i have the same issue with my HTC one M8 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Thanks BLU!  Fantastic job!!!! I will continue to buy your devices.

This was only found by mistake.\"Kryptowire, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability, said the Adups software transmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data to a Chinese server. The code comes preinstalled on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users, said Tom Karygiannis, a vice president of Kryptowire, which is based in Fairfax, Va. \u201cEven if you wanted to, you wouldn\u2019t have known about it,\u201d he said.\"[...]For love of everything this is why you don't include 3rd party software on your devices Blu / Amazon.  I wonder if there will be any compensation for people that bought this device.[ORIGINAL]This is the best phone per dollar I've owned.  My previous phone was the Moto E2.  My interest in picking up the R1 HD was a combination of Android 6 and the low price.  Android 6 allows you to use the SD card as main phone storage so you can truly expand your app installation space.  Keep in mind that all the information below is relative to the Moto E2 from which I upgraded.TLDRMassive upgrade from a Moto E2.  What you get for the price it feels like a complete steal.HitsThe OS and interface response is much faster than the Moto E2.  All the menus and slide functions are smooth and snappy.  Couldn't be happier.  All the main apps I use run fine and load up much faster than the previous phone.I added a 64 GB \"SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC UHS-I\" card and expanded the storage space.  This works perfectly and allows me to download a bunch of state maps for OsmAnd.The outer shell and size are nice and the screen is bright enough for daylight use.MissesThere is no gyroscope.  You will have no compass, aka your arrow on a map will not turn as you turn your phone around.  If you plan to use this phone for a mountain or star finder app avoid this phone.  For travel the arrow updates based on your vector so the arrow will orient the correct direction after you have been moving a while.The camera is not amazing, but it seems just as good or better than the Moto E2.ConcernsI'm not sure about the quality of the internal components.  I have seen a dotted red line flash across the screen the first week I had the phone.  This has stopped but it makes one wonder a bit.The phone rebooted a few times the first day.  The AC adapter may cause reboots.  After the phone rebooted a couple times I used a different AC adapter and this seemed to fix that issue.  The reboots may have been a result of me uninstalling some of the pre-installed apps without ending their process first.  Make sure you check for an update through Android options.SummaryWe will be picking up 2 more of these devices for the family.  Best performance per dollar out there.",

Yes, I dropped it a couple of times; once about three feet from the sidewalk, another time less than 2 feet from the vinyl floor and the screen was fine on both drops (which were short anyway).Here's what happened; I sent a text message and put the phone in my pocket as I stood at the window staring into the horizon and a few seconds later, I got a reply, so I reached into my pocket and when I pulled it out, it was already cracked.  I did not sit nor bang it during the incident.I know it sounds impossible to believe and I was also concerned that it might be a supernatural incident, but I've seen on the reviews a couple of people mention screen cracks for no apparent reason, so who knows what the hell happened..This happened less than four months after I purchased the phones.",

I have never ever used an unlocked phone this is my first unlocked phone ever and omg this phone is amazing.iPhones use nano sims so I bought an adapter set on Amazon used a micro adapter to make my sim compatible with this phone. It has two slots I used slot 2 plug and play my phone number came on all my missed text messages and voicemaios came in.Moral of the story, I didn't buy this phone to be used as a permanent phone I bought It as a temporary phone but after playing with it for 3 days I can say that this phone is amazing and it's a steal for the price.*Hd display*Fast processor every app I open runs smooth*Texting is easy and smooth*Camera is good compared to other cheap phones I have had.This phone isn't a note 7 or a lg G6 for that matter so don't buy it expecting it to be but for the price you will not find a better phone I gurantee you that works for T-MOBILE or whatever gsm Carrier you have. It's a good phone for the money",

I bought this to test out a cheap lower end device and to have for nieces/cousins to play pokemon go on with me. Its quick and smooth and works great with pokemon go. The big problem is the standby battery drain. I'm not sure if it has to do with the amazon ads or what, but I have tried changing several settings and nothing has fixed it. Just now it set for about 30 mins, screen off nothing running and it dropped 6%. If it weren't for this I would seriously thing about using it as a primary device. But for now it is demoted as a cheap backup and toy for my younger relatives.",

    "text": "Update: After BLU saw the review below, they contacted me, had me do a few tests, and then a hard reset. After backing up my files, I did the hard reset. My Wifi came back; when restoring from the cloud I was worried that it had crashed again, but some things just take longer than others. It's been working like new for two days now, Speedtest average 40 Mbps down, 25 Mbps up. Of course it'd be nicer if things never required a hard reset, but they wouldn't design it to be capable of a hard reset if some phones didn't need it!Prior review:It's great at first. But be sure to check the warranty: the warranty expires in a year, and the ability to access wifi expires soon after - for me it was about 13 months before it got very flaky. I know the wifi in my home was fine because I checked it with a Kindle, > 50 MBps; Speedtest on the Blu, 0.03 Mbps. If you want a throwaway phone that only lasts as long as its warranty, this Blu's for you!",

Oddly, this phone seems rather snappy even after I installed a 16GB microSDHC card, turned on adoptable storage and installed about 180 apps. I am actually quite in awe of how fas this phone feels with quite a software load on it. The curved glass feels great and I bought a Poetic case to ensure I don't drop it (slippery like most phones). This is easily a $150 unlocked phone value but it's just nuts that Amazon offers this for less than $60. With the LTE Band 12 update that happened as soon as I booted it up, my T-Mobile coverage is complete. NO HD calling, or WiFi Calling, though. Again, a $60 phone that feels every bit as fast as a Moto G (2016 model), with hardly any bloat and as close to stock Android as possible. This will be a daily driver for a month or so until I decide which higher-end phone to go for, if I do. Still amazed that this performs so well for a cheap, entry-level phone. The camera is not even that bad, but requires good light. In daylight or good light it's just fine.",

Its build quality is at par with any top of the line phone. I am tech geek and have used phones from iPhone, Samsung, LG, HTC, Blackberry, Nokia, Nexus, Motorola, Amazon et. I have not used any lesser brand for so all these years and then here comes $59 deal to grab BLU R1 HD along side ZTE MAX2 from Best Buy. I wasn't disappointed with ZTE either but this phone just a different class. Very well build, awesome screen, very clear and responsive. Physical button on sides are great. Only downside is the camera but I have not tried that in day light outdoors, so far in my office in evening only. Sound quality is decent. For 59 bucks, you can't go wrong. Amazon allow me to order one more at this price. I want to gift one to Mom and another to my Dad.",

    "text": "If you are wanting this phone to use with a prepaid account (such as AT&T; Go Phone) BEWARE!  I wanted to go back to an Android phone, and when this popped up on Prime day I thought it was just what I wanted.  While I like the design of the phone, as well as the amazing display, I quickly learned that the Amazon offers that were popping up were draining the balance on my prepaid phone.  Apparently, even though I don't have a data plan on my account, and even though the phone was not yet set up to wi-fi, those offers were costing me money.  I had close to $50 on my account and in 40 minutes it was gone.  AT&T; was nice enough to put the money back to my account, only to have it used again within an hour.  Again, this is with the cellular data usage, auto updates and wi-fi turned off on the phone!  After AT&T; kindly refunded my account a second time I turned off the phone and removed the SIM card.  In the 3 hours since not a dime has been subtracted from my account, which tells me it's the phone and not a glitch in AT&T;'s service.  This phone would be nice for someone who has an unlimited talk, text, data plan, but for those of us who use the pay as you go option it's nothing but a money pit!",

The display is crisp and clear. I've had no issues with call quality. I have used a fire for years so I wasn't very concerned about the adds. They show as notifications on the lock screen if you also have other notifications up. The camera is middle of the road but not terrible. I do find it gets sluggish if not rebooted once a day. T-Mobile customers just a heads-up the Sim is smaller than the slot so it can be a little tricky to install intially",

The screen resolution is very good-From a hardware perspective, it does everything that my old phone did. No functionality loss.-Battery life is excellent, lasts the entire day without having to be super frugal.-Feels Nice in my hand with metal sides, and rubberized back-plate.-Its good to know that this phone can be easily taken apart, unlike some phones which require a PhD to open up!Cons:-Although the ads are not too intrusive, it feels a little weird when you turn on your phone and you see a full screen ad for Degree Deodorant.-The Loud Speaker is loud enough, but lacks something to be desired.-When I am in very loud places, it becomes a little difficult to hear the other person talk. However this issue can be alleviated with a Volume booster APP-When I am in loud places, it becomes difficult for the other person to make out what I am saying.",

I suspect this will work much better when just listening to music, watching a movie, or using the Net?All in all amazing for the price. I would give a 5 star if there was some sort of instruction manual - online or in the box. At this point I don't see anything like that. If someone will show me where this is I will change the rating to 5.NOTE:Responder below informed me on how to delete unwanted apps. Excellent. Bottomline - amazing for the price.",

    "text": "I bouth this phone over a year ago as a novelty. Its price was cheap, and I didn't mind the ads. I am an Amazon Prime member, so I sort of like the ads for products that may inetrest me and I have a Kindle with ads. The ads never were obstrusive.I got the 16G model and put in a memory chip.  Since I bought the phone as a novelty, because I wanted to see what a $60 android phone was like, I did not have big expectations.  I already had another phone manufactured by Blue. It was a more expensive ($99) Blue Life One XL, so I was familiar with the Blue product line.  My primary phone is an Apple iPhone 6 plus that cost me $600 and change. I had wanted to experience Android, and also, I needed a secondary phone for my work number.Although the R1 HD screen is smaller than my other two phones, it is not that much smalled than my iPhone plus. I have been able to watch movies, Skype, use all sorts of apps with no difficulty. The major thing that bothers me is that the Blue Life One has a built in FM radio. Of course the iPhone doesn't have that, neither does the R1 HD.The most amazing thing for me about the R1 HD is that yesterday, I got a notification that there was an OTA (over the air update) of the software and now it is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow!!!!!  My $99 Blu Life One XL is still running Lollipop and never got an update.I have never experience an issue with processor speed with the R1 HD.  It doesn't have a great speaker, but that is solved with ehadfones or a bluetooth speaker for when I want to watch music.I also like the fact that it is a dual SIM phone. I use it for travelling. I bought a foreign SIM for Mexico, where I travel often, and keep it just makes calling taxis and hotels easier when I travel.Also, you can increase RAM by just adding a memory chip.  With Android 6.0, the internal memory and mmc card become contiguous and you don't have to move apps from the phone to the card anymore.There are dozens of Blu models and other unlocked phones out there, but none is as of great of a bargain as the Blu R1 HD.There is no reason not to buy an R1 HD unless you just adore Apple and iOS or unless you absolutely need a phablet and giant screen.As a second emergency phone or a phone for a pre-adolescent who doesn't need an expensive phone, or as a travel phone, you could not find anything better.Buy it! :)",

    "text": "Pros: Solid phone, lots of storage, autocorrect is better than Samsung's, inexpensive, great for a backup phone, teenager, to just to have around for wifi.Cons: Battery doesn't remove, battery takes at least 3 hours to charge, battery drains pretty fast.I drive with sunglasses on. Even with this screen on the brightest settings I cannot see anything if I'm wearing sunglasses. That might not seem like a big deal, but i wear prescription glasses. I also have to use GPS a lot for work. Also if a client texts with changes in plans, I need to know.  Although I have a list of cons, not being able to see the screen with the brightest settings and sun glasses is the deal breaker for me.Other cons: most of the notifications sound exactly the same. There is no way of separating the email notification from the Facebook notification. Maybe there is an app for that? The only notifications that have unique sound are: texts, Facebook messenger,  and Google hang outs.The alarms are not allowed. Prepare to sleep right through them. I even downloaded btw alarm apps, but i think unless you have the phone set for outside, the alarms just aren't loud.Your notification icons, you have to settle each one to clear it, there is no clear all.Caller ID names saved in your phone don't show up on the first ring or two, just the number.Answering the phone is opposite from the galaxy phones. You have to Swype from right to left to answer. Swyping left to right indicates you want to respond to the caller with a text.When you call a number and plight the phone to your ear, the notifications pop up... So if you need the number pad, you have to get the notifications out of the way.The signal is weak. I have the same provider as i did before changing phones. My old phone has no dead spots in my house. This phone decided half the house is dead zone.My last con for now is it doesn't always alert you of new text messages. I have found several texts that i didn't know I had (no notification, it reads as if i already read them).",

I feel if this is your main phone the functionality will be a bit limited but I'm using it as a backup phone so it works very good for me. There are drawbacks to the phone without question, but for $60 this is a steal. Almost all the functionality that you needed in a smartphone is incorporated. Here are some drawbacks that I found for this phone.1. Don't expect you can play any game that needs a good graphic. It doesn't bother me one bit because I don't use my phone to play games that much but it might be a issue for other people.2. As a result of an low performance GPU, the UI lags and skip frames. The most bothering part is when you're typing I often skip letters because UI can't respond fast enough. This is fairly annoying because it impacts my typing speed quite a bit. I also noticed that there is no vibration when I typed in a character. Perhaps that will reduce the issue a little bit.3. Blutooth somehow doesn't work with my car (Lexus RX-350). Not a big deal since I'm using this as a back up phoneIf you intend to use this phone as a backup phone like I did then definitely go for it. I don't think you can find a better deal.",

The cameras aren't for serious stuff, but if you need to take a picture, you  got something. The lock screen ads are not really annoying, and are a good trade-off for the money you save. The ideal customer for this has the amazon lifestyle, using prime services, and some stuff outside of prime too.  The speaker leaves a little to be desired, but who cares. That's what earplugs and a headset are for. There is one thing that has me peeved, the usb port is not in the center bottom, but on the side, making the device incompatible with a lot of the generic docks out there. I would pay a premium to have a custom dock, but they aren't available as far as I can tell.  This phone is cheap enough to be a standby, and performs well enough to be an everyday phone.After using this a few days, I got a OTA update. I do notice now that some applications, like LInkedIn and the Guardian seem to have problems running on this phone. They both tend to get the \"Wait or quit\" dialog. I haven't tried Facebook.UPDATE. I did a factory refresh, and installed everything fresh, and the problem has greatly reduced. If you run into a problem with the Amazon log in after the factory refresh, just hit skip.I think I found is that a good micro SD might still not work on this device. I tested one before putting it in to format, and it wouldn't get past 20%. Putting in another card stopped the problem.",

This was nothing but a waste of time.I absolutely do not mind the refurbished phone, but when the phone is not fully \"erased\" and the Android OS keeps insisting on asking me, a new user, what was the previous users email address that this phone was initialized with, we have no choice but to return a NON-FUNCTIONING Phone.This is a google Android security feature (good for public, not for refurbished), but Amazon as a premier REFURBISHER, needs to know how to fix this issue - Otherwise you will get nearly 100% return rate on refurbished Android phones.

    "text": "I bought this phone because mu iPhone caught a case of the touch disease. I have had it now for three weeks. It was easy to set up, pop in the sim card, which I had to get a different one because it uses a larger sim than that of the iPhone. Makes calls, browses the internet does everything a smartphone should do.Now it also does things a smart phone should not do. It \"drops\" my SIM card often. Ill pull out my phone and it tells me no sim installed. I have reseated the card a few times in the phone and still have the same problem. The clock changes the time to the east coast often which is a HUGE problem. I use my phones as an alarm clock. When you need to wake up at 5 am to go to work and the phone changed its time three hours ahead it creates a huge hassle. I wake up super tired because of a lack of sleep get ready and by the time I'm dressed and drinking my coffee I notice its only 2 am... so I go back to sleep and set my wife's phone to wake me up. Needless to say, my next purchase was an alarm clock. My last complaint that is decides to reset itself often without my asking it to. which is a problem when I'm in the middle of a phone call.If these problems didn't happen I would give it 4 stars easy but for the price ill deal with these problems.Update___________ 3-16-17I bought the phone in September and now the phone does not boot. Cannot get past android logo. I have contacted Blu but haven't gotten a response. Not happy with the service of the company.",

While it does charge fairly well and lasts all day with moderate use, I would really like this so that I could use it all day as my GPS in my car.2. This screen is polarized. This become an issue with you wear polarized sunglasses. The screen is black unless you have it turned landscape. I always wear polarized lenses, so this was a really big issue.3. No Gyroscope: So much for using most VR apps, such as Google Cardboard. You have to have a Gyroscope for those to work.4. No NFC reader. (means no apple pay, google wallet, of the use of NFC chips)5. Mini-usb port is backward from almost all other phones, if you have a dock, you will not be able to have it docked and see the screen at the same time.Other than that, the phone works very well.

I was a little disheartened by the security breach, but BLU pushed an update fix it rather quickly after they found out.  While it bothered me, it's not a huge deal, because we give the same information to a variety of companies everyday (Facebook, Google, etc).  If they really want to know how stupid I can be on Snapchat more power to them.I am giving it 3 stars because the camera on my phone has some kind of delay.  It is like 2 or 3 seconds.  As my phone is usually the only camera on me, it makes it hard to take decent pics of my 3 and 5 year old boys.  I have taken shots I like, but by the time it actually snaps my boys have moved.  When I am taking shots of stationary objects, the pics come out fine (obviously).  It does take decent pics, but the delay is annoying.  This is the first phone I have had an issue with.  I suppose I should be using my Nikon more anyway.",

I can still get calls but no way to answer since screen is mostly blacked out.  Could not turn the phone off or access setting to reset either.  Contacted the manufacturer and was instructed to follow the  instruction on email for reset and then call back if it doesn't work. I reminded them the screen blacked out and cannot be done.  No email was sent to me but Amazon refunded almost all of what I paid for.  Exchange would have sufficed but the time for that option has already passed.  So 5 star for Amazon customer service.",
